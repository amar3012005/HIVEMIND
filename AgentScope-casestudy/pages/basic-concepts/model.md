## Chat Model

Chat models are the core of the agent, enabling it to generate streaming/non-streaming responses, perform reasoning, and call tools.

<Note>
  The streaming mode in AgentScope chat models is **accumulative** — each yielded response contains all content generated so far, not just the latest delta. This design simplifies consumption since you always have the complete current state without tracking deltas.

| API Provider | Class                | Description                                                                                                                      |
| ------------ | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OpenAI       | `OpenAIChatModel`    | The OpenAI-compatible chat model, supporting OpenAI, Amazon OpenAI, vLLM, DeepSeek, and any model with an OpenAI-compatible API. |
| DashScope    | `DashScopeChatModel` | The unified DashScope API that supports both chat models and multimodal models (e.g. qwen-vl, qwen3.5-plus).                     |
| Anthropic    | `AnthropicChatModel` | Anthropic Claude models, supporting both chat and multimodal models (e.g. claude-2, claude-instant-100k).                        |
| Gemini       | `GeminiChatModel`    | Google Gemini models.                                                                                                            |
| Ollama       | `OllamaChatModel`    | Ollama's local LLM hosting solution.                                                                                             |

To support multi-agent conversations in a chatbot format, AgentScope designs a formatter layer that

* converts AgentScope's `Msg` objects into the expected input format for each LLM API, and
* adopts multi-agent conversation context into the two-role chatbot format by prefixing messages with agent names and wrapping them in `<history>` tags.

Such formatters are distinguished by the suffix `ChatFormatter` (e.g., `DashScopeChatFormatter`) and `MultiAgentFormatter` (e.g., `DashScopeMultiAgentFormatter`) — the former is for two-party conversations (user + assistant), while the latter is for multi-agent conversations.

<Tip>
  For detailed usage examples and a full provider reference table mapping each model class to its corresponding formatter, see [Models](/building-blocks/models).

## TTS Model

TTS (Text-to-Speech) models convert text into audio. AgentScope supports both non-realtime and realtime TTS models:

| API Provider        | Class                                | Description                                                                                        |

| Gemini              | `GeminiTTSModel`                     | Google Gemini's TTS model, offering natural and expressive speech synthesis.                       |

## Realtime Model

Realtime models provide bidirectional, persistent communication over WebSocket, designed primarily for voice agent scenarios where the user speaks and the model responds with speech in real-time.

| API Provider | Class                    | Description                                                                                                                      |

## Embedding Model

Embedding models generate vector representations for text, images, and other data types. These embeddings are used for retrieval, similarity search, and as input features for downstream tasks.
