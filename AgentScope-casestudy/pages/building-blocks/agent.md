## ReAct Agent

`ReActAgent` is the primary built-in agent in AgentScope. It supports:

| Feature                    | Description                                                               |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Realtime steering          | Interrupt the agent at any time during execution                          |
| Memory compression         | Automatically compress long conversation history                          |
| Parallel tool calls        | Execute multiple tool calls concurrently                                  |
| Structured output          | Return typed, schema-validated responses                                  |
| Fine-grained MCP control   | See [MCP integration](/building-blocks/tool-capabilities#mcp-integration) |
| Meta tool                  | Agent-controlled tool management                                          |
| Long-term memory           | Self-controlled persistent memory                                         |
| Plan                       | Break complex tasks into managed subtasks and execute them systematically |
| Automatic state management | See [State & Session Management](#state-session-management)               |

### Realtime Steering

Realtime steering lets you interrupt an agent mid-reply. Call `agent.interrupt()` to cancel the current task. The agent then runs `handle_interrupt()` for post-processing.

```python theme={null}
import asyncio
from agentscope.agent import ReActAgent

async def main():
    # ... agent setup ...

    # Start the agent reply as a task
    reply_task = asyncio.create_task(agent(msg))

    # Interrupt after 1 second
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    await agent.interrupt()

    result = await reply_task
    print(result.get_text_content())
```

<Tip>
  You can override `handle_interrupt` in a subclass to customize the response when an interruption occurs — for example, calling the LLM to generate a context-aware acknowledgment.
</Tip>

### Memory Compression

As conversations grow, token counts can exceed model limits. Enable automatic compression by passing a `CompressionConfig` when creating the agent:

```python theme={null}
from agentscope.agent import ReActAgent
from agentscope.token import CharTokenCounter

agent = ReActAgent(
    name="Assistant",
    sys_prompt="You are a helpful assistant.",
    model=model,
    formatter=formatter,
    compression_config=ReActAgent.CompressionConfig(
        enable=True,
        agent_token_counter=CharTokenCounter(),
        trigger_threshold=10000,  # compress when exceeding 10,000 tokens
        keep_recent=3,            # keep the 3 most recent messages uncompressed
    ),
)
```

When the token count exceeds `trigger_threshold`, the agent compresses older messages into a structured summary with these default fields:

| Field                   | Description                                           |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `task_overview`         | The user's core request and success criteria          |
| `current_state`         | What has been completed, including files and outputs  |
| `important_discoveries` | Constraints, decisions, errors, and failed approaches |
| `next_steps`            | Specific actions needed to complete the task          |
| `context_to_preserve`   | User preferences, domain details, and promises made   |

<Note>
  Compression uses a marking mechanism — old messages are marked as compressed and excluded from future retrievals, while the summary is stored separately. Original messages are preserved.
</Note>

**Customizing compression**

You can control the compression behavior with `summary_schema`, `summary_template`, and `compression_prompt`:

```python theme={null}
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class CustomSummary(BaseModel):
    main_topic: str = Field(max_length=200, description="The main topic of the conversation")
    key_points: str = Field(max_length=400, description="Important points discussed")
    pending_tasks: str = Field(max_length=200, description="Tasks that remain to be done")

agent = ReActAgent(
    name="Assistant",
    sys_prompt="You are a helpful assistant.",
    model=model,
    formatter=formatter,
    compression_config=ReActAgent.CompressionConfig(
        enable=True,
        agent_token_counter=CharTokenCounter(),
        trigger_threshold=10000,
        keep_recent=3,
        summary_schema=CustomSummary,
        compression_prompt=(
            "<system-hint>Summarize the conversation focusing on "
            "the main topic, key points, and pending tasks.</system-hint>"
        ),
        summary_template=(
            "<system-info>Summary:\n"
            "Main Topic: {main_topic}\n\n"
            "Key Points:\n{key_points}\n\n"
            "Pending Tasks:\n{pending_tasks}</system-info>"
        ),
    ),
)
```

<Tip>
  Use a smaller, faster model for compression by specifying `compression_model` and `compression_formatter` to reduce cost and latency.
</Tip>

### Structured Output

Pass a Pydantic `BaseModel` subclass as `structured_model` when calling the agent. The structured result is available in `response.metadata`.

```python theme={null}
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from agentscope.message import Msg

class PersonInfo(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(description="The person's name")
    description: str = Field(description="A one-sentence description")
    age: int = Field(description="The person's age")
    honors: list[str] = Field(description="A list of honors")

response = await agent(
    Msg("user", "Introduce Einstein", "user"),
    structured_model=PersonInfo,
)

print(response.metadata)  # dict with name, description, age, honors
```

<Note>
  `response.get_text_content()` still returns the text content. The structured data is in `response.metadata`.
</Note>

### Planning

The Plan Module enables `ReActAgent` to formally break down complex tasks into manageable sub-tasks and execute them systematically. Pass a `PlanNotebook` instance via the `plan_notebook` parameter to activate it. Once provided, the agent:

* Is automatically equipped with plan management tool functions
* Receives a hint message at the beginning of each reasoning step guiding it through the current plan

<Note>
  The current plan module requires subtasks to be executed sequentially. Parallel subtask execution is on the roadmap.
</Note>

**Key capabilities:**

* **Creating, modifying, abandoning, and restoring** plans
* **Switching** between multiple plans
* **Gracefully handling interruptions** by temporarily suspending the current plan
* **Real-time visualization and monitoring** via plan change hooks

#### PlanNotebook

`PlanNotebook` is the core class. It manages plan state, provides tool functions, and generates hint messages.

| Name           | Type                                            | Description                                                                      |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `max_subtasks` | `int \| None`                                   | Maximum subtasks per plan. Unlimited if `None`.                                  |
| `plan_to_hint` | `Callable[[Plan \| None], str \| None] \| None` | Generates a hint message from the current plan. Defaults to `DefaultPlanToHint`. |
| `storage`      | `PlanStorageBase \| None`                       | Storage for historical plans. Defaults to in-memory.                             |

<Tip>
  The `plan_to_hint` callable is the primary interface for prompt engineering. Provide your own implementation for better performance.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  `PlanStorageBase` inherits from `StateModule`, so plan storage is automatically saved and loaded by session management.
</Tip>

**Core attributes and methods:**

| Type      | Name                                                                                                                                                               | Description                                    |

|           | `remove_plan_change_hook`                                                                                                                                          | Remove a registered plan change hook           |

#### Manual Plan Specification

Create a plan upfront, then pass the `PlanNotebook` to `ReActAgent`:

```python theme={null}
import asyncio
import os
from agentscope.agent import ReActAgent
from agentscope.formatter import DashScopeChatFormatter
from agentscope.model import DashScopeChatModel
from agentscope.plan import PlanNotebook, SubTask

plan_notebook = PlanNotebook()

async def setup_plan() -> None:
    await plan_notebook.create_plan(
        name="Research on Agent",
        description="Conduct a comprehensive research on the LLM-empowered agent.",
        expected_outcome=(
            "A Markdown report answering: 1. What's an agent? "
            "2. What's the current state of the art? "
            "3. What's the future trend?"
        ),
        subtasks=[
            SubTask(
                name="Search agent-related survey papers",
                description=(
                    "Search multiple sources including Google Scholar, arXiv, "
                    "and Semantic Scholar. Must be published after 2021 with "
                    "more than 50 citations."
                ),
                expected_outcome="A paper list in Markdown format",
            ),
            SubTask(
                name="Read and summarize the papers",
                description=(
                    "Read the papers and summarize key points: definition, "
                    "taxonomy, challenges, and key directions."
                ),
                expected_outcome="A summary of key points in Markdown format",
            ),
            SubTask(
                name="Research recent advances of large companies",
                description=(
                    "Research recent advances from Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, "
                    "Anthropic, Alibaba, and Meta via official blogs or news articles."
                ),
                expected_outcome="A recent advances summary in Markdown format",
            ),
            SubTask(
                name="Write a report",
                description="Write a report based on all previous steps.",
                expected_outcome=(
                    "A Markdown report answering: 1. What's an agent? "
                    "2. What's the current state of the art? "
                    "3. What's the future trend?"
                ),
            ),
        ],
    )

    msg = await plan_notebook.get_current_hint()
    print(f"{msg.name}: {msg.content}")

asyncio.run(setup_plan())

agent = ReActAgent(
    name="Friday",
    sys_prompt="You are a helpful assistant.",
    model=DashScopeChatModel(
        model_name="qwen-max",
        api_key=os.environ["DASHSCOPE_API_KEY"],
    ),
    formatter=DashScopeChatFormatter(),
    plan_notebook=plan_notebook,
)
```

#### Agent-Managed Plan Execution

Pass a fresh `PlanNotebook` and let the agent decide when and how to plan. For complex tasks, the agent will create a plan autonomously and execute it step by step:

```python theme={null}
from agentscope.agent import UserAgent

agent = ReActAgent(
    name="Friday",
    sys_prompt="You are a helpful assistant.",
    model=DashScopeChatModel(
        model_name="qwen-max",
        api_key=os.environ["DASHSCOPE_API_KEY"],
    ),
    formatter=DashScopeChatFormatter(),
    plan_notebook=PlanNotebook(),
)

async def interact_with_agent() -> None:
    user = UserAgent(name="user")
    msg = None
    while True:
        msg = await user(msg)
        if msg.get_text_content() == "exit":
            break
        msg = await agent(msg)

asyncio.run(interact_with_agent())
```

#### Plan Visualization and Monitoring

Register a hook to react whenever the plan changes — useful for forwarding plan state to a frontend or logging system:

```python theme={null}
from agentscope.plan import PlanNotebook, Plan

def on_plan_changed(self: PlanNotebook, plan: Plan) -> None:
    """Called whenever the plan is updated.

    Args:
        self: The PlanNotebook instance.
        plan: The updated plan instance.
    """
    # Forward the plan to a frontend or logging system
    ...

plan_notebook.register_plan_change_hook(on_plan_changed)
```

***

## Customizing Agents

AgentScope provides two base classes for building custom agents:

| Class            | Abstract Methods                                | Hooks Supported                           | Description                             |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `AgentBase`      | `reply`, `observe`, `print`, `handle_interrupt` | pre/post reply, observe, print            | Base class for all agents               |
| `ReActAgentBase` | All of above + `_reasoning`, `_acting`          | All of above + pre/post reasoning, acting | Base for ReAct-style agents             |
| `ReActAgent`     | —                                               | All hooks                                 | Production-ready ReAct implementation   |
| `UserAgent`      | —                                               | —                                         | Represents a human user in the pipeline |
| `A2AAgent`       | —                                               | pre/post reply, observe, print            | Communicates with remote A2A agents     |

Inherit from `AgentBase` for simple agents, or `ReActAgentBase` if you want the reasoning/acting separation with corresponding hooks.

```python theme={null}
from agentscope.agent import AgentBase
from agentscope.message import Msg

class MyAgent(AgentBase):
    async def reply(self, msg: Msg) -> Msg:
        # your logic here
        return Msg(self.name, "Hello!", "assistant")

    async def handle_interrupt(self, *args, **kwargs) -> Msg:
        return Msg(self.name, "Interrupted.", "assistant")
```

***

## Agent Hooks

Hooks let you inject custom logic at specific points in an agent's execution without modifying its core code.

### Supported Hook Types

| Agent Class                   | Core Function | Hook Types                        | Description                      |
| ----------------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `AgentBase` & subclasses      | `reply`       | `pre_reply`, `post_reply`         | Before/after the agent replies   |
|                               | `print`       | `pre_print`, `post_print`         | Before/after printing output     |
|                               | `observe`     | `pre_observe`, `post_observe`     | Before/after observing a message |
| `ReActAgentBase` & subclasses | `_reasoning`  | `pre_reasoning`, `post_reasoning` | Before/after the reasoning step  |
|                               | `_acting`     | `pre_acting`, `post_acting`       | Before/after the acting step     |

<Tip>
  Hooks are implemented via metaclass and support inheritance — subclasses automatically inherit hook support from their parent classes.
</Tip>

### Hook Signatures

All pre-hooks share the same signature:

```python theme={null}
from typing import Any
from agentscope.agent import AgentBase

def my_pre_hook(
    self: AgentBase,
    kwargs: dict[str, Any],
) -> dict[str, Any] | None:
    # modify kwargs and return, or return None to leave them unchanged
    return kwargs
```

Post-hooks receive an additional `output` argument:

```python theme={null}
def my_post_hook(
    self: AgentBase,
    kwargs: dict[str, Any],
    output: Any,
) -> Any | None:
    # modify output and return, or return None to leave it unchanged
    return output
```

<Note>
  All positional and keyword arguments of the core function are passed as a single `kwargs` dict. When a hook returns `None`, the next hook receives the most recent non-`None` return value (or the original arguments if all previous hooks returned `None`).
</Note>

### Hook Management

AgentScope provides the following methods to manage instance-level hooks:

| Method                   | Description                                        |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `register_instance_hook` | Register a hook for this instance                  |
| `remove_instance_hook`   | Remove a named hook from this instance             |
| `clear_instance_hooks`   | Clear all hooks of a given type from this instance |

**Example: modifying message content before reply**

```python theme={null}
from agentscope.agent import AgentBase, ReActAgent
from agentscope.message import Msg
from typing import Any

def add_prefix_hook(
    self: AgentBase,
    kwargs: dict[str, Any],
) -> dict[str, Any]:
    msg = kwargs["msg"]
    msg.content = "[reviewed] " + msg.content
    return {**kwargs, "msg": msg}

agent = ReActAgent(...)

agent.register_instance_hook(
    hook_type="pre_reply",
    hook_name="add_prefix",
    hook=add_prefix_hook,
)

# Remove it later
agent.remove_instance_hook("pre_reply", "add_prefix")
```

<Warning>
  Never call the core function (`reply`, `observe`, `print`, `_reasoning`, `_acting`) inside a hook — this will cause an infinite loop.
</Warning>

***

## State & Session Management

### StateModule

`StateModule` is the foundation for state management. Any class that inherits from it can register attributes as part of its state, enabling serialization and restoration.

`AgentBase`, `MemoryBase`, `LongTermMemoryBase`, and `Toolkit` all inherit from `StateModule`.

| Method                                                          | Description                                |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `register_state(attr_name, custom_to_json?, custom_from_json?)` | Register an attribute as part of the state |
| `state_dict()`                                                  | Get the current state as a dictionary      |
| `load_state_dict(state_dict, strict?)`                          | Restore state from a dictionary            |

Attributes that themselves inherit from `StateModule` are automatically included in the parent's state (nested serialization):

```python theme={null}
from agentscope.module import StateModule

class MyMemory(StateModule):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.messages = []
        self.register_state("messages")

class MyAgent(StateModule):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.memory = MyMemory()  # auto-included because MyMemory is a StateModule
        self.name = "Friday"
        self.register_state("name")
```

**Saving and restoring agent state:**

```python theme={null}
import os
from agentscope.agent import ReActAgent
from agentscope.formatter import DashScopeChatFormatter
from agentscope.memory import InMemoryMemory
from agentscope.model import DashScopeChatModel
from agentscope.tool import Toolkit
from agentscope.message import Msg

agent = ReActAgent(
    name="Friday",
    sys_prompt="You are a helpful assistant.",
    model=DashScopeChatModel(
        model_name="qwen-max",
        api_key=os.environ["DASHSCOPE_API_KEY"],
    ),
    formatter=DashScopeChatFormatter(),
    memory=InMemoryMemory(),
    toolkit=Toolkit(),
)

# Save state before any interaction
initial_state = agent.state_dict()

# ... run the agent ...
await agent(Msg("user", "Hello!", "user"))

# Restore to the saved state
agent.load_state_dict(initial_state)
```

### Session Management

A session is a collection of `StateModule` objects (e.g., multiple agents) whose state you want to persist together.

AgentScope provides `JSONSession`, which saves and loads session state as a JSON file named by session ID:

```python theme={null}
from agentscope.session import JSONSession

session = JSONSession(save_dir="./sessions")
```

**Saving a session:**

```python theme={null}
await session.save_session_state(
    session_id="user_1",
    agent=agent,          # keyword argument name must match when loading
)
```

**Loading a session:**

```python theme={null}
await session.load_session_state(
    session_id="user_1",
    agent=agent,          # same keyword argument name as used when saving
)
```

<Note>
  You can pass multiple agents to `save_session_state` and `load_session_state` as keyword arguments. The keyword names must be consistent between save and load calls.
</Note>

<Tip>
  `JSONSession` is a concrete implementation of `SessionBase`. You can implement your own session class with a custom storage backend (e.g., Redis, a database) by subclassing `SessionBase` and implementing `save_session_state` and `load_session_state`.
</Tip>

## A2A Agent

<Warning>
  A2A support is an **experimental feature** and may change in future versions. Current limitations include:

  * Only supports chatbot scenarios (one user, one agent)
  * Does not support real-time interruption
  * Does not support structured output
  * Messages received via `observe` are sent to the remote agent only when `reply` is called
</Warning>

`A2AAgent` lets you communicate with any remote agent that implements the [A2A protocol](https://google.github.io/A2A/). The related classes are:

| Class                        | Description                                          |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `A2AAgent`                   | Agent for communicating with remote A2A agents       |
| `A2AChatFormatter`           | Converts between AgentScope messages and A2A formats |
| `FileAgentCardResolver`      | Loads an Agent Card from a local JSON file           |
| `WellKnownAgentCardResolver` | Fetches an Agent Card from a remote well-known URL   |
| `NacosAgentCardResolver`     | Fetches an Agent Card from a Nacos registry          |

### Obtaining an Agent Card

An Agent Card describes the remote agent's name, capabilities, and connection details. There are four ways to obtain one.

**1. Create manually**

```python theme={null}
from a2a.types import AgentCard, AgentCapabilities

agent_card = AgentCard(
    name="Friday",
    description="A fun chatting companion",
    url="http://localhost:8000",
    version="1.0.0",
    capabilities=AgentCapabilities(
        push_notifications=False,
        state_transition_history=True,
        streaming=True,
    ),
    default_input_modes=["text/plain"],
    default_output_modes=["text/plain"],
    skills=[],
)
```

**2. Fetch from a well-known URL**

```python theme={null}
from agentscope.a2a import WellKnownAgentCardResolver

resolver = WellKnownAgentCardResolver(base_url="http://localhost:8000")
agent_card = await resolver.get_agent_card()
```

**3. Load from a local JSON file**

```python theme={null}
from agentscope.a2a import FileAgentCardResolver

resolver = FileAgentCardResolver(file_path="./agent_card.json")
agent_card = await resolver.get_agent_card()
```

The JSON file should follow this format:

```json theme={null}
{
    "name": "RemoteAgent",
    "url": "http://localhost:8000",
    "description": "Remote A2A Agent",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "capabilities": {},
    "default_input_modes": ["text/plain"],
    "default_output_modes": ["text/plain"],
    "skills": []
}
```

**4. Fetch from Nacos registry**

```python theme={null}
from agentscope.a2a import NacosAgentCardResolver
from v2.nacos import ClientConfig

resolver = NacosAgentCardResolver(
    remote_agent_name="my-remote-agent",
    nacos_client_config=ClientConfig(
        server_addresses="http://localhost:8848",
    ),
)
agent_card = await resolver.get_agent_card()
```

<Note>
  `NacosAgentCardResolver` requires a Nacos server version 3.1.0 or higher with the Agent Registry feature enabled.
</Note>

### Using A2AAgent

Once you have an Agent Card, create an `A2AAgent` and use it like any other agent:

**Chatbot scenario:**

```python theme={null}
from agentscope.agent import A2AAgent, UserAgent

agent = A2AAgent(agent_card=agent_card)
user = UserAgent("user")

msg = None
while True:
    msg = await user(msg)
    if msg.get_text_content() == "exit":
        break
    msg = await agent(msg)
```

**As a tool function (handoff/router pattern):**

```python theme={null}
from agentscope.agent import A2AAgent
from agentscope.message import Msg, TextBlock
from agentscope.tool import ToolResponse

agent = A2AAgent(agent_card=agent_card)

async def delegate_to_remote(query: str) -> ToolResponse:
    """Complete a task through a remote sub-agent.

    Args:
        query (``str``):
            Description of the task for the sub-agent.
    """
    res = await agent(Msg("user", query, "user"))
    return ToolResponse(
        content=[TextBlock(type="text", text=res.get_text_content())],
    )
```

## Realtime Agent

<Note>
  The realtime agent is currently under active development. Contributions, discussions, and feedback are welcome.
</Note>

`RealtimeAgent` is designed for real-time interactions such as voice conversations. It bridges realtime model APIs with your application via a unified event interface.

### Supported Providers

| Provider  | Class                    | Supported Models                                | Input Modalities   | Tool Support |
| --------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------ |

**Initializing a realtime model:**

```python theme={null}
import os
from agentscope.realtime import DashScopeRealtimeModel, OpenAIRealtimeModel, GeminiRealtimeModel

# DashScope
dashscope_model = DashScopeRealtimeModel(
    model_name="qwen3-omni-flash-realtime",
    api_key=os.getenv("DASHSCOPE_API_KEY"),
    voice="Cherry",  # "Cherry", "Serena", "Ethan", "Chelsie"
    enable_input_audio_transcription=True,
)

# OpenAI
openai_model = OpenAIRealtimeModel(
    model_name="gpt-4o-realtime-preview",
    api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
    voice="alloy",  # "alloy", "echo", "marin", "cedar"
    enable_input_audio_transcription=True,
)

# Gemini
gemini_model = GeminiRealtimeModel(
    model_name="gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-preview-09-2025",
    api_key=os.getenv("GEMINI_API_KEY"),
    voice="Puck",  # "Puck", "Charon", "Kore", "Fenrir"
    enable_input_audio_transcription=True,
)
```

### Creating a RealtimeAgent

```python theme={null}
import asyncio
from agentscope.agent import RealtimeAgent
from agentscope.realtime import DashScopeRealtimeModel

async def main():
    agent = RealtimeAgent(
        name="Friday",
        sys_prompt="You are a helpful assistant named Friday.",
        model=DashScopeRealtimeModel(
            model_name="qwen3-omni-flash-realtime",
            api_key=os.getenv("DASHSCOPE_API_KEY"),
        ),
    )

    outgoing_queue = asyncio.Queue()

    async def handle_events():
        while True:
            event = await outgoing_queue.get()
            print(f"Event: {event.type}")

    asyncio.create_task(handle_events())

    await agent.start(outgoing_queue)
    # ... handle inputs ...
    await agent.stop()
```

### Starting a Realtime Conversation

A typical setup uses a WebSocket server (e.g., FastAPI) as the backend and a browser client as the frontend.

**Backend (FastAPI):**

```python theme={null}
import asyncio
import os
from fastapi import FastAPI, WebSocket
from agentscope.agent import RealtimeAgent
from agentscope.realtime import DashScopeRealtimeModel, ClientEvents

app = FastAPI()

@app.websocket("/ws/{user_id}/{session_id}")
async def websocket_endpoint(websocket: WebSocket, user_id: str, session_id: str):
    await websocket.accept()

    frontend_queue = asyncio.Queue()

    agent = RealtimeAgent(
        name="Assistant",
        sys_prompt="You are a helpful assistant.",
        model=DashScopeRealtimeModel(
            model_name="qwen3-omni-flash-realtime",
            api_key=os.getenv("DASHSCOPE_API_KEY"),
        ),
    )

    await agent.start(frontend_queue)

    async def send_to_frontend():
        while True:
            msg = await frontend_queue.get()
            await websocket.send_json(msg.model_dump())

    asyncio.create_task(send_to_frontend())

    while True:
        data = await websocket.receive_json()
        client_event = ClientEvents.from_json(data)
        await agent.handle_input(client_event)
```

**Frontend (JavaScript):**

```javascript theme={null}
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8000/ws/user1/session1');

ws.onopen = () => {
    ws.send(JSON.stringify({
        type: 'client_session_create',
        config: { instructions: 'You are a helpful assistant.', user_name: 'User1' }
    }));
};

ws.onmessage = (event) => {
    const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
    if (data.type === 'response_audio_delta') {
        playAudio(data.delta);
    }
};

function sendAudioChunk(audioData) {
    ws.send(JSON.stringify({
        type: 'client_audio_append',
        session_id: 'session1',
        audio: audioData,  // base64 encoded
        format: { encoding: 'pcm16', sample_rate: 16000 }
    }));
}
```

### Multi-Agent with ChatRoom

`ChatRoom` manages multiple `RealtimeAgent` instances in a shared conversation space, with automatic message broadcasting and unified lifecycle management.

```python theme={null}
import asyncio
import os
from agentscope.pipeline import ChatRoom
from agentscope.agent import RealtimeAgent
from agentscope.realtime import DashScopeRealtimeModel, ClientEvents

async def main():
    agent1 = RealtimeAgent(
        name="Agent1",
        sys_prompt="You are Agent1.",
        model=DashScopeRealtimeModel(
            model_name="qwen3-omni-flash-realtime",
            api_key=os.getenv("DASHSCOPE_API_KEY"),
        ),
    )
    agent2 = RealtimeAgent(
        name="Agent2",
        sys_prompt="You are Agent2.",
        model=DashScopeRealtimeModel(
            model_name="qwen3-omni-flash-realtime",
            api_key=os.getenv("DASHSCOPE_API_KEY"),
        ),
    )

    chat_room = ChatRoom(agents=[agent1, agent2])
    outgoing_queue = asyncio.Queue()

    await chat_room.start(outgoing_queue)

    # Send input — the ChatRoom broadcasts to all agents
    await chat_room.handle_input(
        ClientEvents.ClientTextAppendEvent(
            session_id="session1",
            text="Hello everyone!",
        )
    )

    await chat_room.stop()
```
