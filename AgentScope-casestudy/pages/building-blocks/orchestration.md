Detailed usage examples and component references for multi-agent orchestration

This document covers detailed usage examples and component references for multi-agent orchestration in AgentScope.

## Orchestration Paradigms

AgentScope supports two primary orchestration paradigms for building multi-agent applications:

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Master-Worker Pattern" icon="sitemap">
    A central agent coordinates and delegates tasks to specialized workers. Best for task decomposition, routing, and hierarchical workflows.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Conversation / SOP / Workflow" icon="comments">
    Agents communicate peer-to-peer via `Msg` objects. Best for multi-agent discussions, simulations, and message-driven pipelines.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Master-Worker Pattern

In the master-worker pattern, a central agent (master) coordinates and delegates tasks to subordinate agents (workers). The master agent controls the execution flow and decides which worker should handle each task.

**Key characteristics:**

* Centralized control and decision-making
* Explicit task delegation and routing
* Workers typically don't communicate directly with each other
* Clear hierarchical structure

**Use cases:**

* Task decomposition and parallel execution
* Specialized agents for different domains (e.g., code generation, web search, data analysis)
* Dynamic agent creation based on task requirements
* Complex workflows requiring orchestration logic

**Implementation approaches:**

* **Explicit routing**: Use structured output or tool calls to route tasks to different agents
* **Agent-as-tool**: Wrap sub-agents as tool functions that the master agent can invoke

### Conversation/SOP/Workflow Pattern

In the conversation pattern, agents communicate by broadcasting and passing `Msg` objects among themselves. There's no central controller — agents interact peer-to-peer, and the execution flow emerges from their interactions.

**Key characteristics:**

* Decentralized communication
* Message-driven coordination
* Agents observe and respond to each other's messages
* Flexible, dynamic interaction patterns

**Use cases:**

* Multi-agent discussions and debates
* Collaborative problem-solving
* Simulations with multiple autonomous entities
* Scenarios requiring peer-to-peer communication

**Core tools:**

* **MsgHub**: Automatically broadcasts messages among a group of agents
* **Pipeline**: Provides structured execution patterns (sequential, fanout)

### Combining Both Paradigms

A single application can use both paradigms. For example, a master agent might orchestrate multiple conversation groups, or agents within a conversation might delegate specialized tasks to worker agents.

***

## Master-Worker Pattern

### Explicit Routing

Route user queries to different downstream agents based on the query content.

**Approach 1: Structured Output**

```python theme={null}
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import Literal

class RoutingChoice(BaseModel):
    your_choice: Literal["Content Generation", "Programming", "Search", None] = Field(
        description="Choose the follow-up task",
    )

msg_res = await router(msg_user, structured_model=RoutingChoice)
# msg_res.metadata["your_choice"] == "Programming"
```

**Approach 2: Tool Calls**

Wrap downstream agents as tool functions:

```python theme={null}
from agentscope.tool import Toolkit, ToolResponse

async def generate_python(demand: str) -> ToolResponse:
    """Generate Python code based on the demand."""
    python_agent = ReActAgent(name="PythonAgent", ...)
    res = await python_agent(Msg("user", demand, "user"))
    return ToolResponse(content=res.get_content_blocks("text"))

toolkit = Toolkit()
toolkit.register_tool_function(generate_python)

router = ReActAgent(name="Router", toolkit=toolkit, ...)
await router(msg_user)  # Automatically routes to generate_python if needed
```

### Agent-as-Tool

Wrap entire agents as tool functions to enable dynamic agent creation and delegation. The master agent invokes these tools to create and execute worker agents.

```python theme={null}
from agentscope.tool import Toolkit, ToolResponse, execute_python_code

async def create_worker(task_description: str) -> ToolResponse:
    """Create a worker agent to finish the given task.

    Args:
        task_description: The description of the task to be done by the worker,
            should contain all the necessary information.

    Returns:
        ToolResponse containing the worker's result.
    """
    # Create a toolkit for the worker
    toolkit = Toolkit()
    toolkit.register_tool_function(execute_python_code)

    # Create a worker agent with specific capabilities
    worker = ReActAgent(
        name="Worker",
        sys_prompt="You're a worker agent. Finish the given task using your tools.",
        model=DashScopeChatModel(...),
        formatter=DashScopeChatFormatter(),
        toolkit=toolkit,
    )

    # Execute the task
    res = await worker(Msg("user", task_description, "user"))
    return ToolResponse(content=res.get_content_blocks("text"))


# The master agent uses create_worker as a tool
toolkit = Toolkit()
toolkit.register_tool_function(create_worker)

master = ReActAgent(
    name="Master",
    sys_prompt="Decompose tasks and create workers to finish them.",
    toolkit=toolkit,
    ...
)

await master(Msg("user", "Execute hello world in Python", "user"))
```

**Key benefits:**

* Dynamic worker creation based on task requirements
* Workers can have different capabilities and tools
* Master agent focuses on planning and coordination
* Workers are isolated and can run concurrently

***

## Conversation/SOP/Workflow Pattern

### MsgHub

`MsgHub` is an async context manager that automatically broadcasts messages among a group of agents:

```python theme={null}
import asyncio
import os
from agentscope.agent import ReActAgent
from agentscope.formatter import DashScopeMultiAgentFormatter
from agentscope.message import Msg
from agentscope.model import DashScopeChatModel
from agentscope.pipeline import MsgHub


def create_agent(name, age, career):
    return ReActAgent(
        name=name,
        sys_prompt=f"You're {name}, a {age}-year-old {career}",
        model=DashScopeChatModel(
            model_name="qwen-max",
            api_key=os.environ["DASHSCOPE_API_KEY"],
        ),
        formatter=DashScopeMultiAgentFormatter(),
    )


alice = create_agent("Alice", 50, "teacher")
bob = create_agent("Bob", 35, "engineer")
charlie = create_agent("Charlie", 28, "designer")


async def example_broadcast():
    async with MsgHub(
        participants=[alice, bob, charlie],
        announcement=Msg(
            "user",
            "Now introduce yourself in one sentence.",
            "user",
        ),
    ) as hub:
        await alice()
        await bob()
        await charlie()

asyncio.run(example_broadcast())
```

Example output:

```
Alice: Hello, I'm Alice, a 50-year-old teacher with a passion for education.
Bob: Hello, I'm Bob, a 35-year-old engineer who enjoys solving complex problems.
Charlie: Hi, I'm Charlie, a 28-year-old designer with a keen eye for aesthetics.
```

**Dynamic participant management**:

```python theme={null}
async with MsgHub(participants=[alice]) as hub:
    hub.add(bob)            # Add new participant
    hub.delete(alice)       # Remove participant
    await hub.broadcast(    # Manually broadcast a message
        Msg("system", "Topic changed!", "system"),
    )
```

#### MsgHub Parameter Reference

```python theme={null}
from agentscope.pipeline import MsgHub

async with MsgHub(
    participants=[alice, bob, charlie],
    announcement=Msg("system", "Let's begin.", "system"),
    enable_auto_broadcast=True,
    name="meeting-room",
) as hub:
    await alice()   # Bob and Charlie auto-receive Alice's reply
    await bob()     # Alice and Charlie auto-receive Bob's reply
```

| Parameter               | Default     | Description                                |
| ----------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `participants`          | —           | List of agents to include                  |
| `announcement`          | `None`      | Message(s) to broadcast on enter           |
| `enable_auto_broadcast` | `True`      | Auto-broadcast replies to all participants |
| `name`                  | random UUID | Name identifier for this hub               |

**Methods:**

| Method                         | Description                                      |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `hub.add(agent)`               | Add one or more agents as participants           |
| `hub.delete(agent)`            | Remove one or more agents                        |
| `hub.broadcast(msg)`           | Manually broadcast a message to all participants |
| `hub.set_auto_broadcast(bool)` | Enable/disable auto-broadcast                    |

**How it works:**

When entering the context, `MsgHub` registers each participant as a subscriber of all other participants. When any participant generates a reply via `__call__`, the reply message is automatically sent to all other participants via their `observe()` method. On exit, all subscriptions are cleaned up.

<Note>
  Newly added participants (via `hub.add()`) will not receive previous messages — only future ones.
</Note>

<Note>
  When `enable_auto_broadcast=False`, `MsgHub` only broadcasts via the `announcement` parameter and the `broadcast()` method. This is useful when you want fine-grained control over message routing.
</Note>

### Pipeline

#### Sequential Pipeline

Execute agents in order, passing output from one to the next.

```python theme={null}
from agentscope.pipeline import sequential_pipeline, SequentialPipeline

# Functional style
msg = await sequential_pipeline(agents=[alice, bob, charlie], msg=initial_msg)

# Class-based (reusable)
pipeline = SequentialPipeline(agents=[alice, bob, charlie])
msg = await pipeline(msg=initial_msg)
```

| Parameter | Description                           |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `agents`  | List of agents to execute in order    |
| `msg`     | Initial input message (can be `None`) |

**Behavior**: Equivalent to `msg = await alice(msg); msg = await bob(msg); msg = await charlie(msg)`.

***

#### Fanout Pipeline

Distribute the same input to multiple agents and collect responses.

```python theme={null}
from agentscope.pipeline import fanout_pipeline, FanoutPipeline

# Functional style
msgs = await fanout_pipeline(
    agents=[alice, bob, charlie],
    msg=input_msg,
    enable_gather=True,
)

# Class-based (reusable)
pipeline = FanoutPipeline(agents=[alice, bob, charlie])
msgs = await pipeline(msg=input_msg)
```

| Parameter       | Default | Description                                                    |
| --------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `agents`        | —       | List of agents to receive the input                            |
| `msg`           | —       | Input message (deep-copied for each agent)                     |
| `enable_gather` | `True`  | `True`: concurrent via `asyncio.gather()`. `False`: sequential |

**Returns**: A list of `Msg` objects, one from each agent.

<Tip>
  Choose `enable_gather=True` for performance (parallel I/O), or `False` for deterministic ordering.
</Tip>

***

### Stream Printing Messages

Convert an agent's internal print messages into an async generator for streaming to a web UI or other consumers.

```python theme={null}
from agentscope.pipeline import stream_printing_messages

agent.set_console_output_enabled(False)  # Avoid duplicate output

async for msg, last in stream_printing_messages(
    agents=[agent],
    coroutine_task=agent(Msg("user", "Hello!", "user")),
):
    print(msg.get_text_content(), end="\r")
    if last:
        print()  # Final message
```

| Parameter        | Description                                                            |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `agents`         | List of agents whose print messages to capture                         |
| `coroutine_task` | The coroutine to execute while capturing messages                      |
| `queue`          | Optional custom `asyncio.Queue` (uses agents' shared queue by default) |
| `end_signal`     | Signal string for end of stream (default: `"[END]"`)                   |
| `yield_speech`   | If `True`, yields `(msg, last, speech)` tuples including audio data    |

**How messages are identified**: Messages with the same `msg.id` are considered the same message being updated (streaming). The content is accumulative (not delta), so each yield contains the latest full content.

***

### ChatRoom

```python theme={null}
from agentscope.pipeline import ChatRoom

chat_room = ChatRoom(agents=[agent1, agent2])
await chat_room.start(outgoing_queue)   # Connect all agents
await chat_room.stop()                  # Disconnect all agents
```

| Parameter / Method            | Description                                             |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ChatRoom(agents)`            | Initialize with a list of `RealtimeAgent` instances     |
| `await start(outgoing_queue)` | Connect all agents, start the internal forwarding loop  |
| `await stop()`                | Disconnect all agents, cancel the forwarding loop       |
| `await handle_input(event)`   | Forward a `ClientEvent` from the frontend to all agents |

**Internal forwarding loop**: The `ChatRoom` maintains a central `asyncio.Queue`. When a `ServerEvent` is received from any agent, it is forwarded to the `outgoing_queue` (for the frontend) and broadcast to all other agents (excluding the sender, identified by `agent_id`). When a `ClientEvent` is received, it is distributed to all agents via `handle_input()`.

***

## Formatter Reference

> For an introduction to Chat vs MultiAgent formatters and how to choose one, see [Model — Formatter](/basic-concepts/model#formatter).

### Formatter Table

| Provider  | Chat Formatter           | MultiAgent Formatter           |
| --------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| DashScope | `DashScopeChatFormatter` | `DashScopeMultiAgentFormatter` |
| OpenAI    | `OpenAIChatFormatter`    | `OpenAIMultiAgentFormatter`    |
| Anthropic | `AnthropicChatFormatter` | `AnthropicMultiAgentFormatter` |
| Gemini    | `GeminiChatFormatter`    | `GeminiMultiAgentFormatter`    |
| Ollama    | `OllamaChatFormatter`    | `OllamaMultiAgentFormatter`    |
| DeepSeek  | `DeepSeekChatFormatter`  | `DeepSeekMultiAgentFormatter`  |

All formatters are importable from `agentscope.formatter`.

### Formatting Example

Example of how `DashScopeMultiAgentFormatter` transforms messages:

```python theme={null}
# Input messages
[
    Msg("system", "You're Bob.", "system"),
    Msg("Alice", "Hi!", "user"),
    Msg("Bob", "Nice to meet you.", "assistant"),
    Msg("Charlie", "Me too!", "assistant"),
]

# Formatted output for LLM
[
    {"role": "system", "content": "You're Bob."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "# Conversation History\nThe content between <history></history> tags contains your conversation history\n<history>\nAlice: Hi!\nBob: Nice to meet you.\nCharlie: Me too!\n</history>"},
]
```

The system message is preserved as-is. All other messages are combined into a `&lt;history&gt;` section within a single user message, with each speaker's name prefixed to their text.

***

## Workflow Pattern Examples

This section provides practical code examples demonstrating how to implement common multi-agent orchestration patterns using both paradigms.

### Conversation/SOP Pattern Examples

#### User-Agent Conversation (Chatbot)

The simplest pattern — a user and an agent take turns:

```python theme={null}
import asyncio
import os
from agentscope.agent import ReActAgent, UserAgent
from agentscope.formatter import DashScopeChatFormatter
from agentscope.model import DashScopeChatModel

friday = ReActAgent(
    name="Friday",
    sys_prompt="You're a helpful assistant named Friday",
    model=DashScopeChatModel(
        model_name="qwen-max",
        api_key=os.environ["DASHSCOPE_API_KEY"],
    ),
    formatter=DashScopeChatFormatter(),  # "Chat" formatter for two-party conversation
)
user = UserAgent(name="User")

async def run_chatbot():
    msg = None
    while True:
        msg = await friday(msg)
        msg = await user(msg)
        if msg.get_text_content() == "exit":
            break

asyncio.run(run_chatbot())
```

<Tip>
  Use **`ChatFormatter`** (e.g., `DashScopeChatFormatter`) for user-agent conversations — it uses the `role` field to distinguish user and assistant. Use **`MultiAgentFormatter`** when more than two agents are involved.
</Tip>

#### Multi-Agent Discussion

When more than two agents are involved, use **`MultiAgentFormatter`** (e.g., `DashScopeMultiAgentFormatter`) and **`MsgHub`**:

```python theme={null}
from agentscope.formatter import DashScopeMultiAgentFormatter

# MultiAgentFormatter wraps all messages into a single user message
# with name prefixes, so the LLM can distinguish different speakers
formatter = DashScopeMultiAgentFormatter()
```

The formatter converts multi-party history like this:

```
Alice: Hi!
Bob: Nice to meet you guys.
Charlie: Me too!
```

into a single user message with XML-tagged history, suitable for LLM APIs that only support `user`/`assistant` roles.

Combined with `MsgHub`, a multi-agent discussion is simply:

```python theme={null}
async with MsgHub(
    [alice, bob, charlie],
    announcement=Msg("system", "Introduce yourselves.", "system"),
):
    await alice()
    await bob()
    await charlie()
```

#### Multi-Agent Debate

Multiple agents discuss a topic in rounds, with a moderator deciding when consensus is reached:

```python theme={null}
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class JudgeModel(BaseModel):
    finished: bool = Field(description="Whether the debate is finished.")
    correct_answer: str | None = Field(default=None)


async def run_debate():
    while True:
        # Debaters discuss within MsgHub
        async with MsgHub(participants=[alice, bob, moderator]):
            await alice(Msg("user", "Present your viewpoint.", "user"))
            await bob(Msg("user", "Present your counter-argument.", "user"))

        # Moderator judges outside MsgHub (debaters don't need to see the verdict)
        msg_judge = await moderator(
            Msg("user", "Can you determine the correct answer?", "user"),
            structured_model=JudgeModel,
        )

        if msg_judge.metadata.get("finished"):
            print("Answer:", msg_judge.metadata.get("correct_answer"))
            break

asyncio.run(run_debate())
```

#### Concurrent Agents

Use `asyncio.gather()` to run agents concurrently:

```python theme={null}
async def run_concurrent():
    agent1 = ReActAgent(name="Agent1", ...)
    agent2 = ReActAgent(name="Agent2", ...)

    results = await asyncio.gather(
        agent1(Msg("user", "Task A", "user")),
        agent2(Msg("user", "Task B", "user")),
    )

asyncio.run(run_concurrent())
```

Both agents start simultaneously and run in parallel (since LLM API calls are I/O-bound, `asyncio` handles them efficiently).

<Tip>
  Combine `MsgHub` with `sequential_pipeline` or `fanout_pipeline` for more complex workflows.
</Tip>

#### Realtime Voice Chat Room

For realtime voice agent scenarios, `ChatRoom` orchestrates multiple `RealtimeAgent` instances sharing a session:

```python theme={null}
from agentscope.pipeline import ChatRoom

chat_room = ChatRoom(agents=[agent1, agent2])
await chat_room.start(outgoing_queue)   # Connect all agents, start forwarding loop

# ... handle events ...

await chat_room.stop()                  # Disconnect all agents, cancel forwarding loop
```

Unlike `MsgHub` (which works with text-based agents), `ChatRoom` handles `ServerEvents` and `ClientEvents` in the realtime voice pipeline. When one agent generates a response, `ChatRoom` forwards it both to the frontend and to other agents (excluding the sender).

***

### Master-Worker Pattern Examples

#### Routing

Route user queries to different downstream agents based on the query content. Two approaches:

**Approach 1: Structured Output**

```python theme={null}
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import Literal

class RoutingChoice(BaseModel):
    your_choice: Literal["Content Generation", "Programming", "Search", None] = Field(
        description="Choose the follow-up task",
    )

msg_res = await router(msg_user, structured_model=RoutingChoice)
# msg_res.metadata["your_choice"] == "Programming"
```

**Approach 2: Tool Calls**

Wrap downstream agents as tool functions:

```python theme={null}
from agentscope.tool import Toolkit, ToolResponse

async def generate_python(demand: str) -> ToolResponse:
    """Generate Python code based on the demand."""
    python_agent = ReActAgent(name="PythonAgent", ...)
    res = await python_agent(Msg("user", demand, "user"))
    return ToolResponse(content=res.get_content_blocks("text"))

toolkit = Toolkit()
toolkit.register_tool_function(generate_python)

router = ReActAgent(name="Router", toolkit=toolkit, ...)
await router(msg_user)  # Automatically routes to generate_python if needed
```

#### Orchestrator-Workers (Handoffs)

An orchestrator decomposes tasks and dynamically creates worker agents:

```python theme={null}
from agentscope.tool import execute_python_code

async def create_worker(task_description: str) -> ToolResponse:
    """Create a worker to finish the given task."""
    toolkit = Toolkit()
    toolkit.register_tool_function(execute_python_code)

    worker = ReActAgent(
        name="Worker",
        sys_prompt="You're a worker agent. Finish the given task.",
        model=DashScopeChatModel(...),
        formatter=DashScopeChatFormatter(),
        toolkit=toolkit,
    )
    res = await worker(Msg("user", task_description, "user"))
    return ToolResponse(content=res.get_content_blocks("text"))


# The orchestrator uses create_worker as a tool
toolkit = Toolkit()
toolkit.register_tool_function(create_worker)

orchestrator = ReActAgent(
    name="Orchestrator",
    sys_prompt="Decompose the task and create workers to finish them.",
    toolkit=toolkit,
    ...
)
await orchestrator(Msg("user", "Execute hello world in Python", "user"))
```
