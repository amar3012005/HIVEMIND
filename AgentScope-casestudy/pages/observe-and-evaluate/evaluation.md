The CI/CD Pipeline for Intelligent Agents: From "Code Checks" to "Cognitive Checks"

In traditional software engineering, CI/CD is the heartbeat of development. You wouldn't deploy code without passing tests. However, applying this discipline to Intelligent Agents requires a fundamental paradigm shift, since Code is Deterministic (Logic) but Agents are Probabilistic (Behavior). We are moving from verifying syntax to evaluating cognition

**AgentScope's Evaluation Module** is designed to be the CI/CD pipeline for your Agents. It transforms the vague art of "prompt engineering" into a measurable engineering discipline, providing the infrastructure to quantify reliability, catch regressions, and validate performance before you ship.

It serves three critical roles in your development lifecycle:

  <Card title="Capability" icon="bullseye">
    Can the agent solve the specific tasks (e.g., Coding, Math) it was designed for?
  </Card>

  <Card title="Stability" icon="rotate">
    Does it perform consistently across multiple runs? (e.g., success rate over 10 trials)
  </Card>

  <Card title="Regression Detection" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    Does behavior change when you tweak the system prompt or switch from `qwen2.5-max` to `qwen3-max`?

## Overview

To address the complexity of evaluating agents, AgentScope employs a framework decomposes the evaluation into several key components:

* **Benchmark** is responsible for defining "Task" (what to evaluate) and "Metric" (how to judge it). It is the static standard against which agents are measured.

* **Solution** acts as an Adapter Pattern. Since every Agent might have unique input schemas or memory structures, the framework cannot call them directly. The Solution module standardizes this interaction.

* **Evaluator** orchestrates the workflow. It manages resources, concurrency, and persistence. It serves as the bridge connecting the Benchmark to the Solution.

## The Evaluation Pipeline

Let’s build a complete "Math Capability Evaluation" pipeline to demonstrate how to use the AgentScope evaluation module.

```python theme={null}
TOY_BENCHMARK_DATA = [
    {
        "id": "math_problem_1",
        "question": "What is 2 + 2?",
        "ground_truth": 4.0,
        "tags": {
            "difficulty": "easy",
            "category": "math",
        },
    },
    {
        "id": "math_problem_2",
        "question": "What is 12345 + 54321 + 6789 + 9876?",
        "ground_truth": 83331,
        "tags": {
            "difficulty": "medium",
            "category": "math",
        },
    },
]
```

### Building Metric

In AgentScope, we use `Metric` to define how to grade. A `Metric` accepts a `SolutionOutput` (the agent's answer) and returns a `MetricResult`.

```python theme={null}
class CheckEqual(MetricBase):
    def __init__(self, ground_truth: float):
        super().__init__(
            name="math_accuracy",
            metric_type=MetricType.NUMERICAL,
            description="Checks if output equals ground truth"
        )
        self.ground_truth = ground_truth

    async def __call__(self, solution: SolutionOutput) -> MetricResult:
        # Compare the agent's output against the expected truth
        is_correct = solution.output == self.ground_truth
        return MetricResult(
            name=self.name,
            result=1.0 if is_correct else 0.0,
            message="Correct" if is_correct else "Incorrect"
        )
```

<Tip>
  AgentScope supports deeper analysis beyond simple correctness checks:

  * **Trajectory Analysis**: Use the `trajectory` field in `SolutionOutput` to evaluate the process (e.g., "Did the agent use the Calculator tool?").
  * **LLM-as-a-Judge**: Implement `MetricBase` to use a stronger LLM (like Qwen3-Max) to score subjective qualities such as tone, helpfulness, or safety.
</Tip>

### Constructing Benchmark

A Benchmark is not just a list of questions; it organizes multiple `Tasks` for systematic evaluation.
Crucially, the `Task` is the self-contained unit of evaluation that carries all information and `Metric` for the agent to execute and evaluate (e.g., input/query and its ground truth)

```python theme={null}
from agentscope.evaluate import Task, BenchmarkBase, MetricBase, MetricResult, MetricType, SolutionOutput

class MathBenchmark(BenchmarkBase):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(name="MathBench", description="Basic Arithmetic Test")
        self.dataset = [
            Task(
                id=item["id"],
                input=item["q"],
                ground_truth=item["a"],
                metrics=[CheckEqual(item["a"])] # Attach the judge to the question
            ) for item in TOY_BENCHMARK_DATA
        ]

    def __iter__(self): 
        return iter(self.dataset)
    def __len__(self): 
        return len(self.dataset)
    def __getitem__(self, index: int) -> Task: 
        return self.dataset[index]

```

<Tip>
  AgentScope includes standard benchmarks like [ACEBench](https://github.com/ACEBench/ACEBench), a comprehensive multi-domain evaluation framework for testing AI agents' tool usage and collaboration capabilities across diverse real-world scenarios — test against industry standards immediately.
</Tip>

### Adapting the Agent

The `Solution` is a function that acts as an Adapter. It takes a standardized Task as input and produces a standardized SolutionOutput.
This isolation ensures that you can swap agents without changing the benchmark, or swap benchmarks without rewriting the agent.
We need to define the logic for running agents and retrieving the execution result and trajectory in the `Solution`.

```python theme={null}
import os
from typing import Callable
from pydantic import BaseModel
from agentscope.message import Msg
from agentscope.model import DashScopeChatModel
from agentscope.agent import ReActAgent
from agentscope.evaluate import SolutionOutput

class AnswerFormat(BaseModel):
    answer_as_number: float

async def math_agent_solution(task: Task, pre_hook: Callable) -> SolutionOutput:
    # 1. Initialize the Student (Agent)
    agent = ReActAgent(
        name="MathBot",
        sys_prompt="You are a calculator. Solve the problem.",
        model=DashScopeChatModel(model_name="qwen-max", api_key=os.getenv("DASHSCOPE_API_KEY")),
    )
    
    # 2. Run the Test
    msg = Msg("user", task.input, role="user")
    res = await agent(msg, structured_model=AnswerFormat)
    
    # 3. Submit the Paper (Return SolutionOutput)
    return SolutionOutput(
        success=True,
        output=res.metadata.get("answer_as_number"), # Extract the specific answer
        trajectory=[] # We can capture the reasoning steps here
    )

```

### Running the Evaluator

Evaluators manage the evaluation process. They automatically iterate through tasks in the benchmark and feed each task into a solution-generation function.

```python theme={null}
import asyncio
from agentscope.evaluate import GeneralEvaluator, FileEvaluatorStorage

async def main():
    evaluator = GeneralEvaluator(
        name="Math Evaluation Run",
        benchmark=MathBenchmark(),
        n_repeat=1,  # Set to >1 to test stability
        storage=FileEvaluatorStorage(save_dir="./eval_results"),
    )
    await evaluator.run(math_agent_solution)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())

```

<Tip>
  AgentScope provides `RayEvaluator`, a drop-in replacement for `GeneralEvaluator`. It leverages the [Ray](https://github.com/ray-project/ray) framework to distribute tasks across available CPU/GPU workers, drastically reducing feedback time without requiring changes to your agent logic.

  An example using `RayEvaluator` with [ACEBench](https://github.com/ACEBench/ACEBench) multistep tasks is available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/agentscope-ai/agentscope/tree/main/examples/evaluation/ace_bench).
</Tip>

## Advanced Metrics: Integrating OpenJudge

While simple string matching (like the `CheckEqual` metric) works well for deterministic tasks, you can also implement `MetricBase` to use a stronger LLM to score subjective qualities such as tone, helpfulness, or safety, which are impossible to measure with simple code.

To achieve this without building evaluation prompts from scratch, you can integrate [**OpenJudge**](https://github.com/agentscope-ai/OpenJudge). By connecting OpenJudge to AgentScope, you gain immediate access to 50+ battle-tested, professional-grade graders directly within the AgentScope `MetricBase` architecture.

### Building OpenJudgeMetric

To make OpenJudge compatible with AgentScope, we create an adapter class. This class inherits from `MetricBase` and translates AgentScope's `SolutionOutput` into the payload OpenJudge expects.

```python theme={null}
from agentscope.evaluate import MetricBase, MetricResult, MetricType, SolutionOutput
from openjudge.graders.base_grader import BaseGrader
from openjudge.graders.schema import GraderScore, GraderError
from openjudge.utils.mapping import parse_data_with_mapper

class OpenJudgeMetric(MetricBase):
    """
    A wrapper that converts an OpenJudge grader into an AgentScope Metric.
    """
    def __init__(
        self,
        grader_cls: type[BaseGrader],
        item: dict,
        mapper: dict | None = None,
        name: str | None = None,
        description: str | None = None,
        **grader_kwargs
    ):
        self.grader = grader_cls(**grader_kwargs)
        super().__init__(
            name=name or self.grader.name,
            metric_type=MetricType.NUMERICAL,
            description=description or self.grader.description
        )
        self.item = item
        self.mapper = mapper or {}

    async def __call__(self, solution: SolutionOutput) -> MetricResult:
        if not solution.success:
            return MetricResult(name=self.name, result=0.0, message="Solution failed")

        try:
            # Combine Task Context (item) and Agent Output (solution)
            combined_data = {
                "item": self.item,
                "solution": solution.model_dump()
            }

            # Parse data using the mapper
            grader_inputs = parse_data_with_mapper(combined_data, self.mapper)
            result = await self.grader.aevaluate(**grader_inputs)

            if isinstance(result, GraderScore):
                return MetricResult(name=self.name, result=result.score, message=result.reason or "")
            elif isinstance(result, GraderError):
                return MetricResult(name=self.name, result=0.0, message=f"Error: {result.error}")
            else:
                return MetricResult(name=self.name, result=0.0, message="Unknown result type")

        except Exception as e:
            return MetricResult(name=self.name, result=0.0, message=f"Exception: {str(e)}")

```

### Constructing Benchmark with OpenJudge Graders

Since the `Task` is the self-contained unit of evaluation that carries all information and metrics for the agent to execute and evaluate, we need to define a **Mapper** when constructing it. The mapper tells the wrapper how to extract the query, response, and context from your specific task data to feed into the OpenJudge Grader.

```python theme={null}
from agentscope.evaluate import Task, BenchmarkBase
from openjudge.graders.common.relevance import RelevanceGrader
import os

QA_DATA = [
    {
        "id": "qa_task_1",
        "input": "What are the health benefits of regular exercise?",
        "reference_output": "Regular exercise improves cardiovascular health...",
        "ground_truth": "Answers should cover physical and mental health benefits"
    }
]

class QABenchmark(BenchmarkBase):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(name="QA Benchmark", description="Advanced LLM-as-a-Judge Test")
        self.dataset = []
        
        # Configure the judge model in OpenJudge (e.g., Qwen3-Max)
        model_config = {
            "model": "qwen3-max", 
            "api_key": os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
        }

        for item in QA_DATA:
            # Map OpenJudge standard fields -> AgentScope paths
            mapper = {
                "query": "item.input",
                "response": "solution.output",
                "context": "item.ground_truth"
            }

            # Instantiate the OpenJudge Metric
            relevance_metric = OpenJudgeMetric(
                grader_cls=RelevanceGrader,
                item=item,
                mapper=mapper,
                name="Relevance",
                model=model_config
            )

            # Attach the OpenJudge metric to the Task
            task = Task(
                id=item["id"],
                input=item["input"],
                ground_truth=item["ground_truth"],
                metrics=[relevance_metric] 
            )
            self.dataset.append(task)

    def __iter__(self): 
        return iter(self.dataset)
    def __len__(self): 
        return len(self.dataset)
    def __getitem__(self, index: int) -> Task: 
        return self.dataset[index]

```

Once defined, this `QABenchmark` can be run seamlessly using the exact same `GeneralEvaluator` or `RayEvaluator`  shown in the pipeline overview, standardizing your subjective assessments without changing the orchestrator logic.
