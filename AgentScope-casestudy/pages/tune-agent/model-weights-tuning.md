Using Reinforcement Learning to adjust model weights for agent performance

This tutorial focuses on the **Model Weights Tuning** method, which uses Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize your agent's model parameters. This method can significantly enhance agent performance, but it requires substantial resources, including GPUs.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have:

* AgentScope v1.0.14 or higher
* Linux system
* At least one Nvidia GPU with [compute capability](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda/gpus) 8.0+ (e.g., Nvidia A100, H100, RTX 3090, RTX 4090, RTX 5090, etc.)
* CUDA 12.8 or higher

Install the required dependencies:

```bash theme={null}
pip install trinity-rft>=0.5.1
pip install flash-attn==2.8.1 --no-build-isolation
```

<Tip>
  For installation issues, see the [Trinity-RFT installation guide](https://agentscope-ai.github.io/Trinity-RFT/en/main/tutorial/trinity_installation.html).
</Tip>

Start a Ray cluster to manage distributed tuning:

```bash theme={null}
ray start --head
```

## Refine Workflow Function

Continuing from [Overview](./tune-your-first-agent.mdx), assume you have a task dataset and judge function ready. Now, refine your workflow function for model weights tuning:

```python theme={null}
async def example_workflow_function(
    task: Dict,
    model: ChatModelBase,
) -> WorkflowOutput:
    agent = ReActAgent(
        name="react_agent",
        sys_prompt="You are a helpful math assistant.",
        model=model,  # use the model passed in
        formatter=OpenAIChatFormatter(),
    )

    response = await agent.reply(
        msg=Msg(
            "user",
            task["question"],  # extract question from task
            role="user",
        ),
    )

    return WorkflowOutput(  # wrap the response in WorkflowOutput
        response=response,
    )
```

This refined function now accepts `model` as a input parameter, and uses it to initialize the agent. The `model` has the same interface as `OpenAIChatModel`, but its weights will be tuned during the tuning process.

## Configuration & Tuning

After refining the workflow function, you can set up the tuning configuration and start the tuning process.

```python theme={null}
from agentscope.tuner import tune, AlgorithmConfig, DatasetConfig, TunerModelConfig

# your workflow / judge function here...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    dataset = DatasetConfig(path="my_dataset", split="train")
    model = TunerModelConfig(model_path="Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B", max_model_len=16384)
    algorithm = AlgorithmConfig(
        algorithm_type="multi_step_grpo",
        group_size=8,
        batch_size=32,
        learning_rate=1e-6,
    )
    tune(
        workflow_func=run_react_agent,
        judge_func=judge_function,
        model=model,
        train_dataset=dataset,
        algorithm=algorithm,
    )
```

Key configurations include:

* `DatasetConfig`: Specifies the task dataset for tuning.
  * `path`: The path to the dataset, which can be a local path or a dataset from Hugging Face.
  * `split`: The split of the dataset to be used for tuning (e.g., "train", "test", etc.).
  * `name`: (Optional) The name of the dataset to be used for tuning. Some Huggingface datasets have multiple subsets, you can specify the subset name to select the specific subset for tuning. If not specified, it will use the default subset.

* `TunerModelConfig`: Specifies the model to be tuned.
  * `model_path`: The path to the model, which can be a local path or a model from Hugging Face.
  * `max_model_len`: The maximum sequence length the model can handle. Longer lengths will cost more GPU memory.
  * `inference_engine_num`: The number of inference engines to use for parallel inference. This can help speed up the inference process during tuning. Default is 1.
  * `tensor_parallel_size`: Use tensor parallelism to split the model across multiple GPUs. Set this value to the number of GPUs you want to use for tensor parallelism. Default is 1 (no tensor parallelism).
  * `ulysses_sequence_parallel_size`: Use Ulysses sequence parallelism to split the input sequences across multiple GPUs. Set this value to the number of GPUs you want to use for sequence parallelism. Default is 1 (no sequence parallelism).

<Tip>
  When using tensor or Ulysses sequence parallelism, ensure that your cluster has enough GPUs to accommodate the model. The total number of GPUs used will be:

  `inference_engine_num * tensor_parallel_size + ulysses_sequence_parallel_size`

  If you only have one GPU, please set `inference_engine_num`, `tensor_parallel_size`, and `ulysses_sequence_parallel_size` to 1.
</Tip>

* `AlgorithmConfig`: Specifies the tuning algorithm and its hyperparameters.
  * `algorithm_type`: The type of tuning algorithm to use. Currently, we only recommend using `"multi_step_grpo"` for model weights tuning, which is a variant of GRPO algorithm designed for agentic scenarios.
  * `group_size`: Each task will be executed `group_size` times to collect multiple responses in GRPO series algorithms. A larger group size can provide more stable reward estimates but will increase the tuning time.
  * `batch_size`: The number of tasks to be processed in each tuning iteration.
  * `learning_rate`: The learning rate for updating the model weights during tuning.
  * `save_interval_steps`: The interval (in number of iterations) at which to save the model checkpoints. Default is 100.

Then you can save the above code into a Python file (e.g., `main.py`) and run it:

```bash theme={null}
python main.py
```

## Monitor Tuning Process

Each run creates directory under the current workspace.

```
current_working_directory/
    └── checkpoints/
        └──AgentScope/
            └── Experiment-20260104185355/  # each run saved in a sub-directory with timestamp
                ├── monitor/          # Monitor (e.g., Tensorboard) cache directory
                ├── log/              # tuning logs
                └── global_step_x/    # the model checkpoint saved at step x
```

You can monitor tuning progress with TensorBoard:

```bash theme={null}
tensorboard --logdir checkpoints/AgentScope/<your-experiment-subdir>/monitor/tensorboard
```

## Get Tuned Model

Checkpoints are saved every  `save_interval_steps` steps as introduced in `AlgorithmConfig`. You can find the saved model checkpoints in the corresponding `global_step_x` directory.

The saved checkpoints are in pytorch format, which is hard to use directly. You can use Trinity-RFT CLI to convert them into Hugging Face format for easier usage:

```bash theme={null}
trinity convert --checkpoint-dir checkpoints/AgentScope/Experiment-20260104185355/global_step_100
```

This command will convert the checkpoint saved at step 100 into Hugging Face format and save it in the same directory. Then you copy the converted model to your desired location for later use.

## Advanced Features

This section introduces some advanced features not covered in the above example, which can further improve the tuning performance or provide more insights during the tuning process.

### LLM-as-a-Judge

In addition to using custom judge functions, you can also leverage powerful LLMs as judges to evaluate the agent's performance during tuning. This can be particularly useful when designing a custom judge function is challenging.

However, the tuning process requires frequent calls to the judge model, which can easily reach the rate limits of public LLM APIs. To address this, `tuner` provides `auxiliary_models` to deploy your own judge model in the training cluster.

`auxiliary_models` are different from the main model being tuned, and they are only used within the workflow function and judge function for inference. Below are the steps to set up and use LLM-as-a-Judge in the tuning process:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add `auxiliary_models` parameter">
    Modifiy the signature of your workflow function and judge function and add configurations for the auxiliary models.

    ```python theme={null}

    async def workflow_function(
        task: Dict,
        model: ChatModelBase,
        auxiliary_models: Optional[Dict[str, ChatModelBase]],
    ) -> WorkflowOutput:
        # your workflow logic here...

    async def judge_function(
        task: Dict,
        response: Any,
        auxiliary_models: Optional[Dict[str, ChatModelBase]],
    ) -> JudgeOutput:
        # your judge logic here...
    ```

    The `auxiliary_models` parameter is a dictionary that contains the auxiliary models used in the tuning process.
    You can access the model using `auxiliary_models[model_name]` within your workflow function and judge function.
    Auxiliary models also have the same interface as `OpenAIChatModel`, so you can use them just like others.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure auxiliary models">
    When calling the `tune` function, you can configure the auxiliary models with a dictionary of `TunerModelConfig`.
    And the keys of the dictionary should match the names used in the `auxiliary_models` parameter of your workflow function and judge function.

    ```python theme={null}
    from agentscope.tuner import TunerModelConfig

    auxiliary_models = {
        "judge_model": TunerModelConfig(
            model_path="your-judge-model-path",
            max_model_len=8192,
        ),
    }

    tune(
        workflow_func=workflow_function,
        judge_func=judge_function,
        model=model,
        train_dataset=dataset,
        algorithm=algorithm,
        auxiliary_models=auxiliary_models,
    )
    ```

    <Tip>
      The `auxiliary_models` requires extra GPUs during tuning. Each auxiliary model will occupy `inference_engine_num * tensor_parallel_size` GPUs.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Runtime Monitoring

During the tuning process, it's often helpful to monitor the running status of workflow / judge functions in real time.

You can use the `metrics` parameter in the `WorkflowOutput` and `JudgeOutput` to log metrics you want to monitor during tuning. These metrics will be automatically logged to TensorBoard for visualization. For example:

```python theme={null}
async def workflow_function(
    task: Dict,
    model: ChatModelBase,
) -> WorkflowOutput:
    start_time = time.time()
    # your workflow logic here...
    end_time = time.time()
    return WorkflowOutput(
        response=response,
        metrics={
            "workflow_response_time": end_time - start_time,  # log response time for monitoring
            # you can log any other metrics you want to monitor here...
        },
    )


async def judge_function(
    task: Dict,
    response: Any,
) -> JudgeOutput:
    start_time = time.time()
    # your judge logic here...
    end_time = time.time()
    return JudgeOutput(
        reward=reward,
        metrics={
            "judge_response_time": end_time - start_time,  # log response time for monitoring
            # make sure the metric keys in workflow function and judge function are different to avoid conflicts in TensorBoard
            # you can log any other metrics you want to monitor here...
        },
    )
```

Except for using TensorBoard to visualize the tuning metrics, you can also enable logger-based runtime monitoring to log the runtime information of each function execution.

To enable logger-based runtime monitoring, you only need to add a `logger` parameter to your workflow function and judge function:

```python theme={null}
from logging import Logger

async def workflow_function(
    task: Dict,
    model: ChatModelBase,
    logger: Logger,
) -> WorkflowOutput:
    logger.info(f"Processing task: {task['id']}")
    # your workflow logic here...
    if error_occurred:
        logger.error(f"Error occurred while processing task: {task['id']}")
    logger.info(f"Successfully processed task: {task['id']}")
    # your workflow logic here...
```

The `logger` parameter is an instance of Python's built-in `Logger` class, but it is pre-configured to print logs to both console and log files in the directory introduced in [Monitor Tuning Process](#monitor-tuning-process).
You can use this `logger` to log any information you want during the execution of the workflow function and judge function, which can help you better understand the tuning process and debug if necessary.

Because the tuning process will run multiple parallel workers to execute the workflow function and judge function, each worker will have its own log file in the `log` directory. The log files are named as `explorer_runner_{worker_id}.log`, where `{worker_id}` is the ID of the worker. Below is an example structure of the `log` directory:

```
path/to/log/
    ├── explorer_runner_0.log
    ├── explorer_runner_1.log
    ├── explorer_runner_2.log
    └── ...
```

You can check these log files to see the runtime information of each worker during the tuning process.

### Tuning without Local GPU

Model weights tuning usually requires GPUs for training. If you lack local GPUs, you can still perform tuning by leveraging remote training APIs such as [TuFT](https://github.com/agentscope-ai/TuFT) and [Tinker](https://tinker-docs.thinkingmachines.ai/).

To use these APIs, set the required environment variables before starting the Ray cluster:

```bash theme={null}
# For TuFT, set your server address:
# export TINKER_BASE_URL=http://your-tuft-server-address
export TINKER_API_KEY=your-api-key
ray start --head
```

When configuring the model for tuning, specify a `model_path` supported by your remote training API (e.g., TuFT or Tinker), and provide a `TinkerConfig` with your desired LoRA rank:

```python theme={null}
from agentscope.tuner import TunerModelConfig, TinkerConfig

model = TunerModelConfig(
    model_path="Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507",  # must be a model supported by the remote training API you are using
    max_model_len=16384,
    tinker_config=TinkerConfig(
        rank=16  # LoRA rank for tuning; higher values may improve performance but increase resource usage and tuning time
    )
)
```

Other tuning configurations remain as described in previous sections. For more details, see the [TuFT documentation](https://agentscope-ai.github.io/TuFT) and [Tinker documentation](https://tinker-docs.thinkingmachines.ai/).

### Configuration using YAML File

The examples above show how to configure tuning using Python code. Alternatively, you can use a YAML file for configuration, which is often more convenient for managing complex setups.

The following YAML configuration corresponds to the previous Python example:

```yaml theme={null}
checkpoint_root_dir: ./checkpoints  # Root directory for checkpoints and logs
project: AgentScope                 # Project name (sub-directory under checkpoint_root_dir)
name: Experiment-timestamp          # Experiment name (sub-directory under project)
model:
  model_path: Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B       # Model path (local or Hugging Face)
  max_model_len: 16384              # Maximum sequence length
  max_response_tokens: 4096
algorithm:
  algorithm_type: multi_step_grpo   # Tuning algorithm type (recommended: "multi_step_grpo")
  repeat_times: 8                   # Number of repeats per task (corresponds to group_size)
  optimizer:
    lr: 1e-6                        # Learning rate
buffer:
  total_epochs: 1                   # Total epochs to process the dataset
  batch_size: 32                    # Batch size per tuning iteration
  explorer_input:
    taskset:
      path: '/path/to/my_dataset'   # Dataset path (local or Hugging Face)
      split: 'train'                # Dataset split for tuning
explorer:
  rollout_model:
    engine_num: 1                   # Number of inference engines for parallel inference
    tensor_parallel_size: 1         # Tensor parallelism size
synchronizer:
  sync_style: explorer_driven
  sync_method: 'nccl'
trainer:
  save_interval: 100                # Checkpoint save interval (steps)
  ulysses_sequence_parallel_size: 1 # Ulysses sequence parallelism size
monitor:
  monitor_type: tensorboard         # Monitoring tool (tensorboard, wandb, mlflow, swanlab)
log:
  level: INFO                       # Logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
```

Save this YAML configuration to a file (e.g., `config.yaml`) and load it in your Python code when calling the `tune` function:

```python theme={null}
# Define your workflow and judge functions ...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    tune(workflow_func=workflow_function, judge_func=judge_function, config_path="config.yaml")
```

With this approach, all tuning configurations are loaded from the YAML file, making it easier to manage and modify settings for different runs.

<Tip>
  For Trinity-RFT, YAML configuration is the only supported method. Python code configuration classes in `tuner` are converted to YAML files and passed to Trinity-RFT. For more details, see the [Trinity-RFT Configuration Guide](https://agentscope-ai.github.io/Trinity-RFT/en/main/tutorial/trinity_configs.html).

  If both Python code and YAML configurations are set, Python code takes precedence, allowing you to override specific YAML settings. However, to avoid confusion, it's best to use only one configuration method for consistency.
</Tip>
