# Multi-Agent Tuning

Using the tuner module to tune agents in multi-agent systems

In many real-world applications, agents do not work in isolation — they interact, cooperate, or compete with each other in multi-agent systems. The `tuner` module supports tuning agents within such multi-agent settings, allowing you to optimize a subset of agents while other agents serve as the environment or opponents.

This tutorial builds on the concepts introduced in [Overview](./tune-your-first-agent.mdx) and [Agent Reinforcement Learning](./model-weights-tuning.mdx). Make sure you are familiar with the core components (Task Dataset, Workflow Function, Judge Function) and the basic tuning workflow before proceeding.

We will use a simplified **werewolf game** as the running example throughout this tutorial. In this game, 7 players (2 werewolves, 3 villagers, 1 seer, 1 witch) interact over multiple rounds of discussion and voting. The goal is to train the werewolf players to improve their win rate.

## Key Differences from Single-Agent Tuning

Tuning in a multi-agent system introduces several additional considerations compared to single-agent tuning:

| Aspect                | Single-Agent Tuning              | Multi-Agent Tuning                                  |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Workflow Function** | One agent processes a task       | Multiple agents interact with each other            |
| **Model Assignment**  | One trainable model              | Trainable model + auxiliary models for other agents |
| **Reward Design**     | Based on individual agent output | Based on collective outcome (e.g., game result)     |
| **Judge Function**    | Evaluates single response        | Should be integrated into the workflow              |
| **Complexity**        | Simpler, shorter interactions    | Longer episodes with multi-turn interactions        |

The key idea is straightforward: **assign the trainable model to the agents you want to tune, and use auxiliary models for all other agents**. The `tuner` only updates the weights of the trainable model, while auxiliary models remain frozen during training.

## Design the Workflow Function

In multi-agent tuning, the workflow function orchestrates the entire multi-agent interaction. It creates all agents, assigns models, runs the interaction, and returns the result.

The workflow function accepts two additional parameters compared to single-agent tuning:

* `model`: The trainable model, assigned to the agents you want to tune.
* `auxiliary_models`: A dictionary of auxiliary models for the remaining agents.

Below is a simplified workflow function for the werewolf game, where we train the werewolf players:

```python theme={null}
from typing import Dict
import numpy as np
from agentscope.agent import ReActAgent
from agentscope.formatter import OpenAIChatFormatter
from agentscope.model import ChatModelBase
from agentscope.tuner import WorkflowOutput


async def werewolf_workflow(
    task: Dict,
    model: ChatModelBase,
    auxiliary_models: Dict[str, ChatModelBase],
) -> WorkflowOutput:
    """Run a werewolf game and train the werewolf players."""
    # Define roles and shuffle based on task seed
    roles = ["werewolf"] * 2 + ["villager"] * 3 + ["seer", "witch"]
    np.random.seed(task["seed"])
    np.random.shuffle(roles)

    # Get the auxiliary model for non-trainable players
    participant_model = auxiliary_models["participant"]

    # Create players: werewolves use trainable model, others use auxiliary model
    players = []
    for i, role in enumerate(roles):
        agent = ReActAgent(
            name=f"Player{i + 1}",
            sys_prompt=get_player_prompt(f"Player{i + 1}"),
            model=model if role == "werewolf" else participant_model,
            formatter=OpenAIChatFormatter(),
        )
        players.append(agent)

    # Run the game and compute reward
    good_guy_win = await werewolves_game(players, roles)
    reward = 0.0 if good_guy_win else 1.0  # reward werewolves for winning

    return WorkflowOutput(
        reward=reward,
        metrics={"werewolf_win": float(not good_guy_win)},
    )
```

In this example, the trainable `model` is assigned to the werewolf players, while all other roles (villagers, seer, witch) use the frozen `auxiliary_models["participant"]`. During tuning, only the werewolf model's weights are updated.

<Tip>
  The `auxiliary_models` dictionary keys must match the names you configure later in the `tune()` call. In the example above, the key `"participant"` is used to retrieve the model for non-werewolf players.
</Tip>

## Assign Models to Agents

The core pattern for multi-agent tuning is to **selectively assign** the trainable model to the agents you want to optimize, and auxiliary models to all other agents.

### Tuning a Specific Role

In the werewolf example above, we train only the werewolf players by checking the role:

```python theme={null}
model=model if role == "werewolf" else auxiliary_models["participant"]
```

### Tuning Multiple Roles Simultaneously

You can also train multiple roles at once using the same trainable model. For example, to train all good guy roles (villagers, seer, witch) instead of werewolves:

```python theme={null}
trainable_roles = ["villager", "seer", "witch"]

for i, role in enumerate(roles):
    agent = ReActAgent(
        name=f"Player{i + 1}",
        sys_prompt=get_player_prompt(f"Player{i + 1}"),
        model=model if role in trainable_roles else auxiliary_models["participant"],
        formatter=OpenAIChatFormatter(),
    )
```

<Tip>
  When tuning multiple roles with the same trainable model, the model learns to handle all assigned roles. This is more challenging but can produce a more versatile agent. Start with tuning a single role first to validate your setup.
</Tip>

## Design Rewards for Multi-Agent Systems

Reward design is especially important in multi-agent settings because the outcome depends on the interactions between all agents, not just a single agent's response.

In the werewolf game, the reward is naturally derived from the game outcome — whether the trainable team wins or loses:

```python theme={null}
good_guy_win = await werewolves_game(players, roles)

# Reward from the perspective of the trainable team
if not good_guy_win:  # werewolves win
    reward = 1.0
else:                  # villagers win
    reward = 0.0

return WorkflowOutput(
    reward=reward,
    metrics={"werewolf_win": float(not good_guy_win)},
)
```

When you compute reward directly in the workflow, pass `judge_func=None` to the `tune()` function.

<Tip>
  For multi-agent scenarios without clear win/loss outcomes, you can still use a separate judge function or LLM-as-a-Judge as described in [Agent Reinforcement Learning — LLM-as-a-Judge](./model-weights-tuning.mdx#llm-as-a-judge).
</Tip>

## Handle Errors Gracefully

Multi-agent interactions are inherently more complex and error-prone than single-agent tasks. It is important to handle exceptions in the workflow function to prevent training failures:

```python theme={null}
async def werewolf_workflow(
    task: Dict,
    model: ChatModelBase,
    auxiliary_models: Dict[str, ChatModelBase],
) -> WorkflowOutput:
    try:
        # ... set up agents and run the game ...
        good_guy_win = await werewolves_game(players, roles)
        reward = 0.0 if good_guy_win else 1.0
        return WorkflowOutput(reward=reward, metrics={"success": 1.0})

    except Exception as e:
        # Assign a small penalty for errors instead of crashing
        print(f"Error during game execution: {e}")
        return WorkflowOutput(
            reward=-0.1,
            metrics={"success": 0.0, "error": 1.0},
        )
```

<Tip>
  Assigning a small negative reward (e.g., `-0.1`) for errors discourages the model from producing outputs that cause execution failures, while not overly penalizing the model for occasional issues.
</Tip>

## Configuration & Tuning

After implementing the workflow function, configure the tuning process. The key difference from single-agent tuning is the addition of `auxiliary_models` in the `tune()` call:

```python theme={null}
from agentscope.tuner import tune, AlgorithmConfig, DatasetConfig, TunerModelConfig

# Define your workflow function ...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    dataset = DatasetConfig(
        path="data",  # dataset containing {"seed": 0}, {"seed": 1}, ...
        split="train",
    )

    # The trainable model (will be tuned) — used by werewolf players
    model = TunerModelConfig(
        model_path="Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct",
        max_model_len=16384,
    )

    # Auxiliary models (frozen) — used by other players
    auxiliary_models = {
        "participant": TunerModelConfig(
            model_path="Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507",
            max_model_len=16384,
        ),
    }

    algorithm = AlgorithmConfig(
        algorithm_type="multi_step_grpo",
        group_size=32,
        batch_size=24,
        learning_rate=1e-6,
    )

    tune(
        workflow_func=werewolf_workflow,
        judge_func=None,  # reward computed directly in the workflow
        train_dataset=dataset,
        model=model,
        auxiliary_models=auxiliary_models,
        algorithm=algorithm,
    )
```

Key configuration considerations for multi-agent tuning:

* **`auxiliary_models`**: A dictionary mapping model names to `TunerModelConfig`. The keys must match those used in `auxiliary_models` parameter of your workflow function.
* **`group_size`**: In multi-agent settings, each task episode involves multiple agents interacting over many turns, making each rollout more expensive. Consider balancing group size with available compute resources.
* **`model.max_model_len`**: Multi-agent interactions typically produce longer conversation histories. Set a sufficiently large `max_model_len` to accommodate the full interaction.

<Tip>
  Each auxiliary model requires its own GPU resources (`inference_engine_num * tensor_parallel_size` GPUs per model). Plan your GPU budget accordingly when using multiple auxiliary models.
</Tip>

## Switching Training Target via `workflow_args`

In the werewolf game, you may want to train werewolves in one run and good guys in another, without changing the code. The `tuner` supports passing extra arguments to the workflow function through the task's `workflow_args` field.

```python theme={null}
async def werewolf_workflow(
    task: Dict,
    model: ChatModelBase,
    auxiliary_models: Dict[str, ChatModelBase],
) -> WorkflowOutput:
    roles = ["werewolf"] * 2 + ["villager"] * 3 + ["seer", "witch"]
    # ...

    # Read trainable_target from workflow_args
    workflow_args = task.get("workflow_args", {})
    trainable_target = workflow_args.get("trainable_target", "werewolf")

    for i, role in enumerate(roles):
        if trainable_target == "werewolf":
            use_trainable = role == "werewolf"
        else:  # trainable_target == "good_guy"
            use_trainable = role in ["villager", "seer", "witch"]

        agent = ReActAgent(
            name=f"Player{i + 1}",
            sys_prompt=get_player_prompt(f"Player{i + 1}"),
            model=model if use_trainable else auxiliary_models["participant"],
            formatter=OpenAIChatFormatter(),
        )
    # ...
```

You can configure `workflow_args` in your YAML configuration file:

```yaml theme={null}
buffer:
  explorer_input:
    taskset:
      workflow_args:
        trainable_target: werewolf  # or "good_guy"
```

This allows you to switch the training target simply by modifying the configuration file, without changing any code.
