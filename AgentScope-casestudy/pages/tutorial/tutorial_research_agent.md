# Personal Research Assistant
Source: https://agentscope-ai-786677c7.mintlify.app/tutorial/tutorial_research_agent

Building a personal research assistant with AgentScope.

This tutorial guides you from a basic conversational agent, progressively
adding tools, memory, and a knowledge base, to build a fully functional
personal research assistant.

Imagine you are a **computer science engineer** with a keen interest in
the development of artificial intelligence — especially large language
models and the Transformer architecture. You want your assistant to:

* Search for the latest academic papers and technical news
* Perform Q\&A based on downloaded paper PDFs
* Remember your research interests and preferences, and proactively
  leverage this information in future conversations

You will learn the following core features step by step:

| Capability                    | Corresponding Component                        |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Create and configure an agent | `ReActAgent`, `Msg`, `DashScopeChatModel`      |
| Enable the agent to use tools | `Toolkit`, `ToolResponse`, MCP protocol        |
| Give the agent memory         | `InMemoryMemory`, `ReMePersonalLongTermMemory` |
| Build a local knowledge base  | `PDFReader`, `SimpleKnowledge`, `QdrantStore`  |

## Environment Setup

```bash theme={null}
# Install AgentScope (including qdrant dependencies for RAG)
pip install 'agentscope[rag]'

# If you need long-term memory
pip install 'agentscope[reme]'

# Set API Keys
export DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=your_dashscope_api_key
# If you need Tavily search (optional)
export TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key
```

<Tip>
  The mock sections in Part 1 and Part 2 only require `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` to run.
</Tip>

```python theme={null}
import asyncio
import json
import os
import subprocess
import urllib.request
from datetime import datetime

from agentscope.agent import ReActAgent
from agentscope.formatter import DashScopeChatFormatter
from agentscope.memory import InMemoryMemory
from agentscope.message import Msg, TextBlock
from agentscope.model import DashScopeChatModel
from agentscope.tool import Toolkit, ToolResponse, execute_python_code

api_key = os.environ.get("DASHSCOPE_API_KEY", "")


def download_file(url: str, path: str) -> None:
    """Download a file, falling back to curl if urllib fails."""
    try:
        urllib.request.urlretrieve(url, path)
    except Exception:
        # (Bad file descriptor). Use curl as a robust fallback.
        subprocess.run(
            ["curl", "-fSL", "-o", path, url],
            check=True,
        )


# ------------------------------------------------------------------ #
# Pre-download: fetch the paper PDF before any asyncio.run() calls,  #
# because repeated event-loop creation can corrupt urllib's sockets.  #
# ------------------------------------------------------------------ #
paper_url = "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762"
paper_path = os.path.join(
    os.path.dirname(__file__),
    "attention_is_all_you_need.pdf",
)

if not os.path.exists(paper_path):
    print("Downloading paper PDF (required for Part 4)...")
    download_file(paper_url, paper_path)
    print(f"Download complete: {paper_path}")
else:
    print(f"Paper already exists: {paper_path}")
```

## Part 1: Get Started in 5 Minutes — Your First Agent

In AgentScope, building an agent requires understanding just three
core components:

* **Model** — The large language model, the agent's "brain"
* **Agent** — The intelligent entity with a name, persona, memory,
  and tools
* **Message (Msg)** — A conversation message containing content and
  metadata

Their relationship is:
**User sends Msg → Agent thinks with Model → Returns Msg**.

### 1.1 Creating a Chat Model and Agent

Let's start by creating a basic research assistant. Note that the
`sys_prompt` includes a user profile.

```python theme={null}
model = DashScopeChatModel(
    model_name="qwen-max",
    api_key=api_key,
    stream=True,
)

assistant = ReActAgent(
    name="ResearchAssistant",
    sys_prompt=(
        "You are a professional research assistant. "
        "The user is particularly interested in AI development, "
        "especially the progress of large language models. "
        "Your answers should be accurate and well-organized."
    ),
    model=model,
    formatter=DashScopeChatFormatter(),
    memory=InMemoryMemory(),
    toolkit=Toolkit(),
)
```

### 1.2 Basic Conversation

Send a message and get the agent's reply.

```python theme={null}
async def demo_basic_chat() -> None:
    """Basic conversation: the agent responds to the user's introduction."""
    response = await assistant(
        Msg(
            "User",
            "Hello! I'm a computer engineer who has recently become very "
            "interested in large language model technologies. "
            "What can you help me with?",
            "user",
        ),
    )
    print("Assistant:", response.get_text_content())


asyncio.run(demo_basic_chat())
```

### 1.3 Multi-Turn Conversation

The agent comes with short-term memory (`InMemoryMemory`), which
retains conversation history within the current session.

```python theme={null}
async def demo_multi_turn() -> None:
    """Multi-turn conversation: the agent remembers context."""
    await assistant(
        Msg(
            "User",
            "I'm currently working in NLP, mainly focusing on the latest "
            "advances in Transformer architectures",
            "user",
        ),
    )
    response = await assistant(
        Msg("User", "Do you remember which technical area I'm focusing on?",
            "user"),
    )
    print("Assistant:", response.get_text_content())


asyncio.run(demo_multi_turn())
```

## Part 2: Giving the Assistant "Hands" — Tool Calling

Large language models can only "talk" but cannot "act". Through tools,
the agent can search the internet, execute code, call external APIs,
and more.

### 2.1 Local Mock Tools

Tools are just ordinary Python functions that return a `ToolResponse`
object. AgentScope automatically extracts the JSON Schema from the
function signature and docstring.

```python theme={null}
def search_papers(query: str, limit: int = 5) -> ToolResponse:
    """Search for academic papers.

    Args:
        query (str):
            Search keywords, e.g. "transformer attention mechanism"
        limit (int):
            Number of results to return, default is 5
    """
    mock_papers = [
        {
            "title": "Attention Is All You Need",
            "authors": "Vaswani et al.",
            "year": 2017,
            "citations": 120000,
            "summary": "Proposes the Transformer architecture, replacing "
            "RNN/CNN with Self-Attention",
        },
        {
            "title": "BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers",
            "authors": "Devlin et al.",
            "year": 2018,
            "citations": 95000,
            "summary": "A pre-trained language model based on the "
            "Transformer Encoder",
        },
        {
            "title": "Language Models are Few-Shot Learners (GPT-3)",
            "authors": "Brown et al.",
            "year": 2020,
            "citations": 35000,
            "summary": "Demonstrates the few-shot learning capabilities "
            "of large-scale language models",
        },
    ]

    result = (
        f"Found {len(mock_papers)} papers related to \"{query}\":\n\n"
    )
    for i, p in enumerate(mock_papers[:limit], 1):
        result += (
            f"{i}. {p['title']} ({p['authors']}, {p['year']})\n"
            f"   Citations: {p['citations']} | Summary: {p['summary']}\n\n"
        )
    return ToolResponse(content=[TextBlock(type="text", text=result)])


def take_notes(title: str, content: str) -> ToolResponse:
    """Save research notes to a local file.

    Args:
        title (str):
            Note title
        content (str):
            Note content
    """
    timestamp = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M")
    with open("research_notes.md", "a", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        f.write(f"## [{timestamp}] {title}\n\n{content}\n\n---\n\n")
    return ToolResponse(
        content=[TextBlock(type="text", text=f"Note saved: {title}")],
    )
```

#### Register Tools and Create a Tool-Equipped Agent

In addition to custom tools, AgentScope provides built-in tool functions
such as `execute_python_code` that can be registered directly.

```python theme={null}
toolkit = Toolkit()
toolkit.register_tool_function(search_papers)
toolkit.register_tool_function(execute_python_code)
toolkit.register_tool_function(take_notes)

print("Registered tools:")
for name in toolkit.tools:
    print(f"  - {name}")

print("\nTool JSON Schema:")
print(json.dumps(toolkit.get_json_schemas(), indent=2, ensure_ascii=False))
```

Create a tool-equipped agent and test it.

```python theme={null}
research_agent = ReActAgent(
    name="ResearchAssistant",
    sys_prompt=(
        "You are a research assistant serving a computer engineer "
        "interested in AI and Transformer technologies. "
        "When the user's question requires searching papers or computation, "
        "proactively use the appropriate tools. "
        "Use the take_notes tool to record important information."
    ),
    model=model,
    formatter=DashScopeChatFormatter(),
    memory=InMemoryMemory(),
    toolkit=toolkit,
)


async def demo_mock_tools() -> None:
    """Demonstrate the agent with mock tools."""
    # The agent will automatically decide to call search_papers
    await research_agent(
        Msg("User", "Help me search for papers on the Transformer "
            "architecture", "user"),
    )

    # The agent will call execute_python_code
    await research_agent(
        Msg(
            "User",
            "Please calculate the parameter count of BERT-base: "
            "12 layers * 768 dims * 768 dims * 4, and return the result",
            "user",
        ),
    )

    # The agent will call take_notes
    await research_agent(
        Msg(
            "User",
            "Please make a note: The core innovation of Transformer is "
            "the Self-Attention mechanism, which enables parallel "
            "processing of sequential data",
            "user",
        ),
    )


asyncio.run(demo_mock_tools())
```

### 2.2 Connecting to Real Search — Tavily MCP (Optional)

[MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) is a
standardized tool protocol. AgentScope natively supports MCP, enabling
plug-and-play integration with various external services.

[Tavily](https://tavily.com/) is a search API designed for AI agents,
providing an MCP Server. Once connected, the agent gains real internet
search capabilities.

> **Note:** This code requires setting the `TAVILY_API_KEY` environment
> variable and installing Node.js (for `npx` to launch the Tavily
> MCP Server). If you don't have these set up yet, you can skip this
> section and continue using the mock tools from Part 2.1.

```python theme={null}
from agentscope.mcp import StdIOStatefulClient

async def demo_tavily_mcp():
    tavily_client = StdIOStatefulClient(
        name="tavily",
        command="npx",
        args=["-y", "tavily-mcp@latest"],
        env={"TAVILY_API_KEY": os.environ["TAVILY_API_KEY"]},
    )
    await tavily_client.connect()

    mcp_toolkit = Toolkit()
    await mcp_toolkit.register_mcp_client(tavily_client)
    mcp_toolkit.register_tool_function(execute_python_code)
    mcp_toolkit.register_tool_function(take_notes)

    mcp_agent = ReActAgent(
        name="ResearchAssistant",
        sys_prompt="You are a research assistant that uses search "
                   "tools to get the latest information.",
        model=model,
        formatter=DashScopeChatFormatter(),
        memory=InMemoryMemory(),
        toolkit=mcp_toolkit,
    )

    await mcp_agent(
        Msg("User", "Search for the latest improvements to the "
            "Transformer architecture in 2025", "user"),
    )
    await tavily_client.close()

asyncio.run(demo_tavily_mcp())
```

## Part 3: Giving the Assistant "Memory"

Memory enables the agent to not only remember "what was just said"
(short-term memory), but also to remember "who you are" across
sessions (long-term memory).

| Type                               | Implementation Class         | Use Case                                      |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Short-term Memory (Working Memory) | `InMemoryMemory`             | Conversation context within a single session  |
| Long-term Memory                   | `ReMePersonalLongTermMemory` | User profiles and preferences across sessions |

### 3.1 Short-Term Memory

`InMemoryMemory` is the most basic memory component.

```python theme={null}
memory = InMemoryMemory()


async def demo_short_term_memory() -> None:
    """Short-term memory: add, retrieve, and check size."""
    await memory.add(
        Msg("User", "I'm a computer engineer, mainly working on Agent "
            "application development", "user"),
    )
    await memory.add(
        Msg("Assistant", "Hello! Agent development involves many "
            "interesting technologies.", "assistant"),
    )
    await memory.add(
        Msg("User", "Recently I've become very interested in large "
            "language models and the Transformer architecture", "user"),
    )
    await memory.add(
        Msg(
            "Assistant",
            "Transformer is one of the most important architectures "
            "in the AI field today.",
            "assistant",
        ),
    )

    messages = await memory.get_memory()
    print(f"Memory contains {len(messages)} messages")
    size = await memory.size()
    print(f"Memory size: {size}")


asyncio.run(demo_short_term_memory())
```

#### Memory Marks

Use marks to categorize messages for easy filtering later.

```python theme={null}
async def demo_memory_marks() -> None:
    """Memory Marks: categorize and filter messages."""
    mark_memory = InMemoryMemory()

    await mark_memory.add(
        Msg("User", "Search for Transformer papers", "user"),
    )
    await mark_memory.add(
        Msg(
            "system",
            "User is a computer engineer interested in AI and "
            "Transformer technologies",
            "system",
        ),
        marks="hint",
    )
    await mark_memory.add(
        Msg("system", "Called the search_papers tool", "system"),
        marks="tool",
    )

    hints = await mark_memory.get_memory(mark="hint")
    chat = await mark_memory.get_memory(exclude_mark="tool")
    print(f"hint messages: {len(hints)}, after excluding tool: {len(chat)}")


asyncio.run(demo_memory_marks())
```

#### Memory Compression

Automatically compress old messages when conversation exceeds the
model's context window.

```python theme={null}
from agentscope.token import CharTokenCounter

agent_with_compression = ReActAgent(
    name="ResearchAssistant",
    sys_prompt="You are a research assistant.",
    model=model,
    formatter=DashScopeChatFormatter(),
    memory=InMemoryMemory(),
    toolkit=Toolkit(),
    compression_config=ReActAgent.CompressionConfig(
        enable=True,
        agent_token_counter=CharTokenCounter(),
        trigger_threshold=3000,
        keep_recent=5,
    ),
)
```

#### Memory Persistence

Export and restore memory state for cross-process session recovery.

```python theme={null}
async def demo_persistence() -> None:
    """Memory persistence: export → save to file → restore."""
    persist_memory = InMemoryMemory()
    await persist_memory.add(
        Msg("User", "My research focus is NLP and Transformer", "user"),
    )

    state = persist_memory.state_dict()
    state_file = "/tmp/memory_state.json"
    with open(state_file, "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        json.dump(state, f, ensure_ascii=False)
    print(f"State saved to: {state_file}")

    new_memory = InMemoryMemory()
    with open(state_file, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        new_memory.load_state_dict(json.load(f))

    restored = await new_memory.get_memory()
    print(f"Restored {len(restored)} messages")


asyncio.run(demo_persistence())
```

### 3.2 Long-Term Memory — Remembering "Who You Are"

Short-term memory only persists within a single session.
`ReMePersonalLongTermMemory`, based on the
[ReMe](https://github.com/agentscope-ai/ReMe) framework, can store
and retrieve user profile information across sessions.

> **Note:** Using long-term memory requires an additional installation:
> `pip install 'agentscope[reme]'`.

The code below demonstrates the workflow of recording and retrieving
user profiles. We write user background information (computer engineer,
interested in AI) into long-term memory, which the agent can retrieve
at any time.

```python theme={null}
from agentscope.memory import ReMePersonalLongTermMemory
from agentscope.embedding import DashScopeTextEmbedding

long_term_memory = ReMePersonalLongTermMemory(
    agent_name="ResearchAssistant",
    user_name="researcher",
    model=DashScopeChatModel(
        model_name="qwen-max",
        api_key=os.environ["DASHSCOPE_API_KEY"],
        stream=False,
    ),
    embedding_model=DashScopeTextEmbedding(
        model_name="text-embedding-v4",
        api_key=os.environ["DASHSCOPE_API_KEY"],
        dimensions=1024,
    ),
    vector_store_dir="./memory_store",
)

async def demo_long_term_memory():
    async with long_term_memory:
        # Record user profile
        await long_term_memory.record_to_memory(
            thinking="Record the user's background and research "
                     "interests",
            content=[
                "User is a computer science engineer working on "
                "LLM Agent development",
                "User is very interested in large language models "
                "and the Transformer architecture",
                "User is studying the Attention Is All You Need paper",
                "User prefers using Python for technical experiments",
            ],
        )

        # Retrieve
        result = await long_term_memory.retrieve_from_memory(
            keywords=["research interests", "technical background"],
            limit=3,
        )
        for block in result.content:
            print(block["text"])
```

When integrating with an agent, the recommended approach is to use
`agent_control` mode, allowing the agent to manage memory
autonomously:

```python theme={null}
agent = ReActAgent(
    name="ResearchAssistant",
    sys_prompt="You are a research assistant with long-term memory "
               "capabilities. ...",
    model=model,
    formatter=DashScopeChatFormatter(),
    memory=InMemoryMemory(),
    toolkit=toolkit,
    long_term_memory=long_term_memory,
    long_term_memory_mode="agent_control",
)
```

## Part 4: Giving the Assistant "Knowledge" — RAG Integration

**R**etrieval-**A**ugmented **G**eneration (RAG) enables the
agent to retrieve information from documents you provide, rather than
relying solely on knowledge from its training data.

```text theme={null}
User Question → [Embedding] → Vector Search → Relevant Doc Chunks → LLM Generates Answer
```

### 4.1 Paper PDF

We use the classic *Attention Is All You Need* paper as an example.
The paper has been pre-downloaded to `paper_path` at script startup.

```python theme={null}
print(f"Using paper: {paper_path}")
```

### 4.2 Building the Knowledge Base

Use `PDFReader` to parse the paper, and `SimpleKnowledge` +
`QdrantStore` to build a vector knowledge base.

> **Note:** Requires `pip install 'agentscope[rag]'` for qdrant
> dependencies.

```python theme={null}
from agentscope.embedding import DashScopeTextEmbedding
from agentscope.rag import PDFReader, SimpleKnowledge, QdrantStore

embedding_model = DashScopeTextEmbedding(
    api_key=api_key,
    model_name="text-embedding-v4",
    dimensions=1024,
)


async def build_knowledge() -> SimpleKnowledge:
    """Download paper → parse with PDFReader → write to vector store."""
    vector_store = QdrantStore(
        location=":memory:",
        collection_name="transformer_paper",
        dimensions=1024,
    )
    knowledge = SimpleKnowledge(
        embedding_model=embedding_model,
        embedding_store=vector_store,
    )

    pdf_reader = PDFReader(chunk_size=1024, split_by="paragraph")
    docs = await pdf_reader(pdf_path=paper_path)
    print(f"Paper split into {len(docs)} document chunks")

    await knowledge.add_documents(docs)
    print("Knowledge base construction complete")
    return knowledge


knowledge = asyncio.run(build_knowledge())
```

### 4.3 Agentic RAG

Register knowledge retrieval as a tool, letting the agent autonomously
decide when to query the knowledge base.

> **Tip:** An alternative approach is Generic RAG — pass `knowledge`
> directly to `ReActAgent`'s `knowledge` parameter for automatic
> retrieval each turn. Agentic RAG offers more flexibility, while
> Generic RAG is simpler.

```python theme={null}
async def demo_agentic_rag() -> None:
    """Agentic RAG: the agent uses the retrieve_knowledge tool."""
    rag_toolkit = Toolkit()
    rag_toolkit.register_tool_function(search_papers)
    rag_toolkit.register_tool_function(execute_python_code)
    rag_toolkit.register_tool_function(
        knowledge.retrieve_knowledge,
        func_description=(
            "Retrieve relevant information from the Transformer paper "
            "knowledge base. Use this when the user asks about technical "
            "details such as Transformer architecture, Self-Attention, "
            "Multi-Head Attention, etc."
        ),
    )

    rag_agent = ReActAgent(
        name="ResearchAssistant",
        sys_prompt=(
