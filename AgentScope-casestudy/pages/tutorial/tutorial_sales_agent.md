Building a multi-agent customer support system using AgentScope

This tutorial walks you through building an intelligent customer support
system powered by multi-agent collaboration, showcasing AgentScope's
multi-agent orchestration capabilities.

You will learn the following core features step by step:

| Feature               | Purpose                                            |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Structured Output** | Structured output for routing decisions            |
| **MsgHub**            | Multi-agent message broadcasting and collaboration |
| **Handoffs**          | Agent task delegation and dynamic dispatching      |
| **Hooks**             | Human-in-the-Loop review                           |

## Environment Setup

```bash theme={null}
# Install AgentScope
pip install agentscope

# Set the API Key
export DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

```python theme={null}
import asyncio
import os
from typing import Any, Literal

from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

from agentscope.agent import AgentBase, ReActAgent, UserAgent
from agentscope.formatter import (
    DashScopeChatFormatter,
    DashScopeMultiAgentFormatter,
)
from agentscope.memory import InMemoryMemory
from agentscope.message import Msg, TextBlock
from agentscope.model import DashScopeChatModel
from agentscope.pipeline import MsgHub
from agentscope.tool import Toolkit, ToolResponse
```

## Part 1: A Single Customer Support Agent

First, let's create a basic customer support agent. This is the simplest
scenario — a single agent handles all customer inquiries.

```python theme={null}
def create_support_agent() -> ReActAgent:
    """Create a basic customer support agent."""
    model = DashScopeChatModel(
        model_name="qwen-max",
        api_key=os.environ.get("DASHSCOPE_API_KEY"),
        stream=True,
    )

    return ReActAgent(
        name="CustomerSupport",
        sys_prompt="""You are a professional customer service representative \
responsible for helping customers resolve their issues.

You should:
1. Answer customer questions politely and patiently
2. Accurately understand customer needs
3. Provide clear and helpful responses
4. For issues you cannot resolve, explain why and offer alternatives""",
        model=model,
        formatter=DashScopeChatFormatter(),
        memory=InMemoryMemory(),
        toolkit=Toolkit(),
    )


async def demo_basic_support() -> None:
    """Demonstrate the basic customer support agent."""
    agent = create_support_agent()

    queries = [
        "When will my order arrive?",
        "I'd like to return an item. How do I do that?",
        "What benefits does your membership offer?",
    ]

    for query in queries:
        print(f"\nCustomer: {query}")
        response = await agent(Msg("Customer", query, "user"))
        print(f"Support: {response.get_text_content()}")


asyncio.run(demo_basic_support())
```

### Limitations of a Single Agent

While a single agent can handle basic conversations, it has obvious
limitations:

* Cannot handle all types of issues (technical, order, and complaint
  inquiries each require specialized knowledge)
* Complex problems require collaboration across multiple areas of expertise
* Lacks routing and dispatching mechanisms

Next, we'll implement intelligent routing using **Structured Output**.

## Part 2: Intelligent Routing — Issue Classification

Use **Structured Output** to have the agent produce structured routing
decisions. By defining the output format with a Pydantic `BaseModel`,
the agent will return structured data according to the specified schema,
making it easy for downstream processing.

> **Tip:** When using the `structured_model` parameter, it is recommended
> to set the model's `stream` to `False` to ensure the integrity
> of structured output.

```python theme={null}
class RouteDecision(BaseModel):
    """Structured output for routing decisions."""

    category: Literal["technical", "order", "complaint", "general"] = Field(
        description=(
            "Issue category: technical (technical issues), "
            "order (order issues), complaint (complaints), "
            "general (general inquiries)"
        ),
    )
    confidence: float = Field(
        description="Classification confidence, between 0 and 1",
        ge=0,
        le=1,
    )
    summary: str = Field(
        description="Brief summary of the issue",
    )
    priority: Literal["low", "medium", "high"] = Field(
        description="Issue priority",
    )


def create_router_agent() -> ReActAgent:
    """Create a router agent."""
    model = DashScopeChatModel(
        model_name="qwen-max",
        api_key=os.environ.get("DASHSCOPE_API_KEY"),
        stream=False,  # Recommended to disable stream for structured output
    )

    return ReActAgent(
        name="Router",
        sys_prompt="""You are an intelligent routing system responsible for \
analyzing customer issues and deciding which specialized team should \
handle them.

Classification rules:
- technical: Product usage issues, technical failures, feature inquiries
- order: Order status, logistics, returns and exchanges
- complaint: Dissatisfaction, complaints, compensation requests
- general: Membership, promotions, general inquiries

Priority rules:
- high: Complaints, urgent order issues
- medium: General order and technical issues
- low: Inquiry-type questions""",
        model=model,
        formatter=DashScopeChatFormatter(),
        memory=InMemoryMemory(),
        toolkit=Toolkit(),
    )


async def demo_routing() -> None:
    """Demonstrate intelligent routing classification."""
    router = create_router_agent()

    queries = [
        "My order shows shipped, but I haven't received it after three days",
        "The app keeps crashing. What should I do?",
        "This is terrible! I demand a full refund!",
        "Do you have student discounts?",
    ]

    for query in queries:
        print(f"\nCustomer: {query}")

        # Use structured_model to get structured output
        response = await router(
            Msg("Customer", query, "user"),
            structured_model=RouteDecision,
        )

        # Retrieve the structured result from metadata
        decision = response.metadata
        print(f"  → Category: {decision.get('category')}")
        print(f"  → Priority: {decision.get('priority')}")
        print(f"  → Confidence: {decision.get('confidence')}")
        print(f"  → Summary: {decision.get('summary')}")


asyncio.run(demo_routing())
```

### Advantages of Structured Output

* Output format is controllable, facilitating programmatic processing
  and downstream logic branching
* Includes meta-information like confidence scores, which can be used
  for fallback strategies
* Supports Pydantic model validation, automatically constraining data
  types and ranges

<Note>
  Structured output is stored in `response.metadata`, while `response.get_text_content()` still returns the text content.
</Note>

## Part 3: Multi-Agent Collaboration — MsgHub and Handoff

When a system involves multiple specialized agents, a mechanism is needed
for them to collaborate efficiently. AgentScope provides multiple
multi-agent collaboration patterns. Here we introduce two commonly
used patterns:

1. **MsgHub** — Message broadcasting mode where all participants share
   context
2. **Handoff** — Task delegation mode where the Orchestrator dynamically
   creates Workers to complete sub-tasks

Below we implement both patterns and then provide a comparative analysis.

### 3.1 MsgHub — Message Broadcasting Collaboration

`MsgHub` is AgentScope's message broadcasting hub that allows multiple
agents to "hear" each other's conversations within the same context,
forming a natural multi-party discussion.

```text theme={null}
                    MsgHub
                      ↓
    ┌─────────────────┼─────────────────┐
    ↓                 ↓                 ↓
 TechAgent       OrderAgent      ComplaintAgent
    │                 │                 │
    └────────── Message Broadcast ──────┘
```

* Agent calls within a MsgHub automatically broadcast messages
* Every agent can "hear" other agents' replies
* This creates a natural multi-party conversation, ideal for scenarios
  that require collective discussion

```python theme={null}
def create_model() -> DashScopeChatModel:
    """Create a shared model instance."""
    return DashScopeChatModel(
        model_name="qwen-max",
        api_key=os.environ.get("DASHSCOPE_API_KEY"),
        stream=True,
    )


def create_specialist_agent(
    name: str,
    specialty: str,
    description: str,
) -> ReActAgent:
    """Create a specialized customer support agent.

    Args:
        name: Agent name.
        specialty: Area of expertise.
        description: Detailed description.
    """
    return ReActAgent(
        name=name,
        sys_prompt=f"""You are {name}, specializing in {specialty}.

{description}

When collaborating with other support agents:
- Listen carefully to your colleagues' opinions
- Provide insights within your area of expertise
- If the issue is outside your specialty, suggest handing it off to the \
appropriate colleague""",
        model=create_model(),
        # Use MultiAgentFormatter for multi-agent scenarios
        formatter=DashScopeMultiAgentFormatter(),
        memory=InMemoryMemory(),
        toolkit=Toolkit(),
    )


# Create the specialized agent team
tech_agent = create_specialist_agent(
    "TechSupport",
    "technical support",
    "You are an expert in product technical issues, troubleshooting, "
    "and feature usage guidance.",
)

order_agent = create_specialist_agent(
    "OrderSupport",
    "order services",
    "You handle order inquiries, logistics tracking, and returns/exchanges.",
)

complaint_agent = create_specialist_agent(
    "ComplaintHandler",
    "complaint handling",
    "You handle customer complaints, soothe emotions, and provide solutions.",
)


async def demo_msghub() -> None:
    """Demonstrate MsgHub multi-agent collaboration.

    All participants share context within the same MsgHub.
    Each agent's reply is automatically broadcast to other participants.
    """
    customer_issue = (
        "The app on my phone won't open, and the order shows it hasn't "
        "shipped yet. This is really disappointing!"
    )

    # Use MsgHub to enable multi-agent collaboration
    async with MsgHub(
        participants=[tech_agent, order_agent, complaint_agent],
    ):
        # Technical support analyzes the technical issue first
        await tech_agent(
            Msg(
                "Coordinator",
                f"Customer issue: {customer_issue}\n"
                "Please have technical support analyze the technical problem.",
                "user",
            ),
        )

        # Order support checks the order status (can see tech support's reply)
        await order_agent(
            Msg("Coordinator", "Please have order support check the "
                "order status.", "user"),
        )

        # Complaint handler synthesizes information and provides a solution
        # (can see the discussion from the previous two agents)
        await complaint_agent(
            Msg(
                "Coordinator",
                "Please synthesize all the above information and provide "
                "the customer with a satisfactory solution.",
                "user",
            ),
        )


asyncio.run(demo_msghub())
```

### 3.2 Handoff — Task Delegation Pattern

Handoff (task handover/delegation) is another important multi-agent
collaboration pattern.

Unlike MsgHub's "broadcast discussion", Handoff uses an
**Orchestrator-Workers** architecture:

* An Orchestrator is responsible for decomposing tasks
* It dynamically creates Worker agents through tool calls
* Each Worker independently completes a sub-task and returns the result
  to the Orchestrator

In AgentScope, Handoff is implemented by wrapping agent creation and
invocation as **tool functions** — when the Orchestrator calls a tool,
the tool function internally creates and runs a specialized Worker agent.

```text theme={null}
Orchestrator Agent
    ├── 🔧 create_tech_worker(task)   → TechWorker Agent
    ├── 🔧 create_order_worker(task)  → OrderWorker Agent
    └── 🔧 create_complaint_worker(task) → ComplaintWorker Agent
```

The core advantages of this pattern are:

1. **Dynamism**: Workers can be created on-demand or pre-defined
2. **Context isolation**: Workers do not share context with each other, reducing context pressure.
   The Orchestrator autonomously decides which tool to call (i.e., which
   specialized agent to delegate to).

First, let's define the tool functions that Workers will use:

```python theme={null}
def query_order(order_id: str) -> ToolResponse:
    """Query order status.

    Args:
        order_id (``str``):
            The order ID.
    """
    # Simulate order data
    orders = {
        "12345": {"status": "shipped", "eta": "2024-01-20"},
        "67890": {"status": "processing", "eta": "2024-01-22"},
    }
    order = orders.get(order_id, {"status": "not_found"})
    return ToolResponse(
        content=[TextBlock(type="text", text=f"Order {order_id}: {order}")],
    )
```

Next, define the tool functions for creating each type of specialized
Worker:

```python theme={null}
async def create_tech_worker(task_description: str) -> ToolResponse:
    """Create a technical support Worker agent to handle technical issues.

    Args:
        task_description (``str``):
            Description of the technical issue to handle.
    """
    worker = ReActAgent(
        name="TechWorker",
        sys_prompt=(
            "You are a technical support specialist, skilled in product "
            "technical issues, troubleshooting, and feature usage guidance. "
            "Please answer the user's technical questions professionally "
            "and accurately."
        ),
        model=DashScopeChatModel(
            model_name="qwen-max",
            api_key=os.environ.get("DASHSCOPE_API_KEY"),
            stream=False,
        ),
        formatter=DashScopeChatFormatter(),
        memory=InMemoryMemory(),
        toolkit=Toolkit(),
    )
    res = await worker(Msg("user", task_description, "user"))
    return ToolResponse(content=res.get_content_blocks("text"))


async def create_order_worker(task_description: str) -> ToolResponse:
    """Create an order service Worker agent to handle order-related issues.

    Args:
        task_description (``str``):
            Description of the order issue to handle.
    """
    # Equip the order Worker with the order query tool
    toolkit = Toolkit()
    toolkit.register_tool_function(query_order)

    worker = ReActAgent(
        name="OrderWorker",
        sys_prompt="You are an order service specialist, responsible for "
        "order inquiries, logistics tracking, and returns/exchanges.",
        model=DashScopeChatModel(
            model_name="qwen-max",
            api_key=os.environ.get("DASHSCOPE_API_KEY"),
            stream=False,
        ),
        formatter=DashScopeChatFormatter(),
        memory=InMemoryMemory(),
        toolkit=toolkit,
    )
    res = await worker(Msg("user", task_description, "user"))
    return ToolResponse(content=res.get_content_blocks("text"))


async def create_complaint_worker(task_description: str) -> ToolResponse:
    """Create a complaint handling Worker agent to handle customer complaints.

    Args:
        task_description (``str``):
            Description of the complaint to handle.
    """
    worker = ReActAgent(
        name="ComplaintWorker",
        sys_prompt=(
            "You are a complaint handling specialist, responsible for "
            "dealing with customer complaints, soothing emotions, and "
            "providing reasonable solutions. Your goal is to ensure "
            "customer satisfaction."
        ),
        model=DashScopeChatModel(
            model_name="qwen-max",
            api_key=os.environ.get("DASHSCOPE_API_KEY"),
            stream=False,
        ),
        formatter=DashScopeChatFormatter(),
        memory=InMemoryMemory(),
        toolkit=Toolkit(),
    )
    res = await worker(Msg("user", task_description, "user"))
    return ToolResponse(content=res.get_content_blocks("text"))
```

Now create the Orchestrator and register the Worker creation functions
as tools:

```python theme={null}
async def demo_handoff() -> None:
    """Demonstrate the Handoff (Orchestrator-Workers) pattern.

    The Orchestrator autonomously decides which specialized Worker to
    delegate to via tool calls.
    """
    # Register the specialized Worker creation functions as tools
    toolkit = Toolkit()
    toolkit.register_tool_function(create_tech_worker)
    toolkit.register_tool_function(create_order_worker)
    toolkit.register_tool_function(create_complaint_worker)

    orchestrator = ReActAgent(
        name="Orchestrator",
        sys_prompt="""You are the Orchestrator of the customer support system.

Your responsibilities are:
1. Analyze customer issues and determine which specialized support is needed
2. Delegate sub-tasks to the appropriate Workers (via tool calls)
3. Summarize the results from each Worker and provide the final response

For complex issues, you can delegate to multiple Workers in parallel.""",
        model=DashScopeChatModel(
            model_name="qwen-max",
            api_key=os.environ.get("DASHSCOPE_API_KEY"),
            stream=False,
            generate_kwargs={"parallel_tool_calls": True},
        ),
        memory=InMemoryMemory(),
        formatter=DashScopeChatFormatter(),
        toolkit=toolkit,
        parallel_tool_calls=True,
    )

    # A complex customer issue involving multiple aspects
    customer_issue = (
        "The app on my phone won't open, and the order shows it hasn't "
        "shipped yet. This is really disappointing!"
    )

    print(f"Customer: {customer_issue}")
    response = await orchestrator(
        Msg("Customer", customer_issue, "user"),
    )
    print(f"\nFinal Response:\n{response.get_text_content()}")


asyncio.run(demo_handoff())
```

### 3.3 MsgHub vs Handoff — Comparison and Selection Guide

Below is a comparison of the core differences between the two multi-agent
collaboration patterns:

| Feature                    | MsgHub (Message Broadcasting)                                                          | Handoff (Task Delegation)                                                           |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Collaboration Mode**     | Equal discussion, multi-party conversation                                             | Hierarchical division, task dispatching                                             |
| **Context Sharing**        | All participants share the complete conversation context                               | Workers only receive the task description assigned by the Orchestrator              |
| **Execution Flow**         | Requires explicit orchestration of call order                                          | Orchestrator autonomously decides which Worker to invoke                            |
| **Use Cases**              | Multi-party brainstorming, cross-referencing opinions, debate and discussion scenarios | Clear task decomposition, independent sub-task processing, parallelizable scenarios |
| **Communication Overhead** | High (each message is broadcast to all participants)                                   | Low (communication only between Orchestrator and Workers)                           |
| **Flexibility**            | Participants must be known in advance                                                  | New Worker types can be created dynamically                                         |

**Selection Guidelines**:

* If the problem requires multiple experts to **discuss and reference
  each other's opinions** → Use MsgHub
* If the problem can be decomposed into **independent sub-tasks**
  → Use Handoff
* In complex systems, both can be **used together**: the Orchestrator
  delegates sub-tasks via Handoff, while certain sub-tasks internally
  use MsgHub for multi-agent collaborative discussion

## Part 4: Human-in-the-Loop — Using Hooks for Manual Review

In critical business scenarios, AI-generated responses may need
**manual review** before being sent to the customer. AgentScope's
**Hook mechanism** provides an elegant way to implement
Human-in-the-Loop without modifying the agent's core code.

Hooks are **extension features** of the agent's core functions, allowing
custom logic to be injected before and after execution:

```text theme={null}
Agent.__call__()
  ├── pre_reply hooks   ← Review/modify input before agent replies
  ├── reply()            ← Agent core logic
  └── post_reply hooks  ← Review/modify output after agent replies
```

For `ReActAgent`, there are more fine-grained hooks:

```text theme={null}
ReActAgent.reply()
  ├── pre_reasoning / post_reasoning  ← Before/after reasoning
  └── pre_acting / post_acting        ← Before/after action execution
```

> **Tip:** Hooks are implemented via metaclass and support inheritance.
> Subclasses automatically inherit Hook support from parent classes.

The most common Human-in-the-Loop scenario is: after the agent generates
a response, a human reviewer confirms whether it is satisfactory.
If not, the agent is asked to regenerate.

> **Important:** Hook function signatures are fixed:
>
> * **Pre-hook**: `(self, kwargs) -> dict | None`
> * **Post-hook**: `(self, kwargs, output) -> Any | None`
>
> Where `self` is the agent instance, `kwargs` is the function
> arguments dictionary, and `output` is the function return value.
> Returning `None` means no modification.

```python theme={null}
async def human_review_post_reply_hook(
    self: AgentBase,
    kwargs: dict[str, Any],
    output: Msg,
) -> Msg | None:
    """Post-reply hook: perform manual review after the agent replies.

    If the manual review does not pass, the review feedback is appended
    to the original input and the agent is called again to generate a
    new response.

    Args:
        self: The agent instance.
        kwargs: The argument dictionary of the reply function.
        output: The response message generated by the agent.

    Returns:
        Returns None if the review passes (keeping the original reply),
        otherwise returns the revised reply.
    """
    print("\n" + "=" * 50)
    print("[Manual Review] Agent response:")
    print(f"  {output.get_text_content()}")
    print("=" * 50)
