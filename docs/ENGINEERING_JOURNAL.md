# HIVEMIND Engineering Journal

This is the human-readable index of committed work and accepted production
releases. Git is the source of truth; every entry must cite immutable commit
SHAs, release IDs, and verification evidence. Do not record plans, guesses,
or uncommitted changes as completed work.

## Required Session Protocol

1. At session start, read the latest entries, `git log origin/hivemind-main`,
   `docs/PRODUCTION_RELEASE.md`, and `docs/PRODUCTION_RELEASE_PROTOCOL.md`.
2. Before coding, add a `Started` entry with the branch, owner, scope, and
   base SHA. Do not claim an outcome yet.
3. After a pushed code commit, append a `Committed` entry that links only the
   pushed SHA and affected files/services.
4. After production acceptance, append an `Accepted release` entry with the
   immutable release ID, running image digests, verification evidence, and
   rollback tag. Update `PRODUCTION_RELEASE.md` in the same commit.
5. If a release fails or is rolled back, append the failure and rollback
   reference. Never edit, delete, or rewrite older entries.

## Entry Template

```md
## YYYY-MM-DD UTC - Short outcome

- State: Started | Committed | Accepted release | Rolled back | Blocked
- Owner: Claude | Codex | Human
- Branch: `branch-name`
- Base / commit: `base-sha` -> `pushed-sha`
- Scope: files and production services changed
- Verification: exact command, test, curl, or `not run`
- Production: release ID, image digest, and runtime tag; `not deployed` if absent
- Rollback: immutable tag or `not applicable`
- Next: one concrete next action
```

## Current Git Baseline

## 2026-07-19 UTC - SINGULANCE deployment governor started

- State: Started
- Owner: Codex
- Branch: `codex/singulance-01`
- Base / commit: `3cca4b6b24ede1647a69a133c17a248a88000f0d` -> `pending`
- Scope: repository deployment governance, deprecated legacy operator, and
  cache-preserving `scripts/quick-deploy.sh`; no application service change.
- Verification: shell syntax, diff check, and static policy checks pending.
- Production: not deployed
- Rollback: not applicable
- Next: verify, commit, push the session branch, then integrate separately.

## 2026-07-19 UTC - SINGULANCE deployment governor committed

- State: Committed
- Owner: Codex
- Branch: `codex/singulance-01`
- Base / commit: `3cca4b6b24ede1647a69a133c17a248a88000f0d` -> `484b9dcb`
- Scope: `DEPLOY_GOVERNOR.md`, governing agent instructions, and
  `scripts/quick-deploy.sh`; cache-preserving service selection, exclusive
  deployment lock, and fetched-commit image-label verification.
- Verification: `bash -n scripts/quick-deploy.sh`, `git diff --check`, and
  production host availability check for `/usr/bin/flock` passed.
- Production: not deployed
- Rollback: not applicable
- Next: integrate a focused frontend release and deploy through the governed
  quick-deploy path.

## 2026-07-19 UTC - Cache-preserving frontend release accepted

- State: Accepted release
- Owner: Codex
- Branch: `singulance-main`
- Base / commit: `3cca4b6b24ede1647a69a133c17a248a88000f0d` -> `0705d294`
- Scope: removed two verified-unused landing videos and deployed the governed
  frontend image; Core, Control, Employees, and TARA were unchanged.
- Verification: Docker dependency install was cached; the image label matched
  `0705d2947adcbec5e29be75811a46dc2a0cec0ba`; both removed files were absent
  from `/srv`; `/hivemind` and `/hivemind/m/chat` returned `200`; no fresh
  frontend fatal/error log lines were found.
- Production: `0705d294`, `hivemind/fe:latest-single`; `/srv` reduced to
  `73.6M` from `100.7M`.
- Rollback: `hivemind/fe:stable-single` via
  `/root/quick-deploy.sh --rollback fe`.
- Next: replace CRA with Vite or move frontend compilation to CI/image
  publishing; the current full CRA compilation took about 93 seconds.

## 2026-07-16 UTC - Contextual durable-memory ingestion

- State: Started
- Owner: Codex
- Branch: `codex/contextual-durable-ingestion`
- Base / commit: `3bf522e63ac7f76703c8252770c2a1211ae750d5` -> `pending`
- Scope: `core/src/knowledge/document-first-ingestion.js` and its focused
  promotion contract test; no frontend or production service change.
- Verification: `node --check core/src/knowledge/document-first-ingestion.js`
  and `git diff --check`; focused test awaits the production-image release gate
  because this clean worktree has no installed dependencies.
- Production: not deployed
- Rollback: not applicable
- Next: commit, push, review, then release from the post-merge `hivemind-main` SHA.

## 2026-07-16 UTC - Contextual durable-memory ingestion committed

- State: Committed
- Owner: Codex
- Branch: `codex/contextual-durable-ingestion`
- Base / commit: `3bf522e63ac7f76703c8252770c2a1211ae750d5` -> `62f697e0b86e4c8fa3062acf41070a61f29615d1`
- Scope: document-level curated memory cap, contextual extraction and curation
  contracts, OpenRouter-aware metered curator routing, and source-provenance test.
- Verification: `node --check core/src/knowledge/document-first-ingestion.js`
  and `git diff --check` passed; focused test is deferred to the production
  image because this isolated worktree has no dependency installation.
- Production: not deployed
- Rollback: not applicable
- Next: push the branch, obtain review, merge, and run production-image plus
  authenticated upload/recall acceptance from the merged SHA.

## 2026-07-16 UTC - Canonical maps and Elements baseline

- State: Committed
- Owner: prior release session
- Branch: `hivemind-main`
- Base / commit: `19fa016d` -> `3a500111c3ae8fbe62aef12604cf95bdb629af51`
- Scope: Google Maps connector catalog, HyperAgents Elements frontend, and
  release-ledger documentation.
- Verification: Git remote history only; this entry does not claim live
  runtime acceptance.
- Production: consult `docs/PRODUCTION_RELEASE.md` and the running image tags.
- Rollback: not applicable
- Next: reconcile any new feature branch into `hivemind-main` before release.
