# Singulance Feature Registry

This append-only registry is the global record of features accepted on
`singulance-main`. Add an entry only after the governed production release and
runtime verification have completed. Use the same feature identifier in
Cloudflare Agent Memory and in the `singulance-local` registry.

## feature-20260829T203749Z — Day 1 lifecycle default-on

- Production status: deployed, globally enabled, and verified.
- Capability: reusable Cloudflare Workflow lifecycle for Day 1 research delivery,
  responsive branded email rendering, Humation character colors, and projection
  of every accepted transactional email into platform notifications.
- Runtime commit: `d843a66885878a605c4bc6d9589e207d568433b4`.
- Cloudflare: Flagship app `2e89fbd3-7496-459b-a507-f1017d444dd9`, flag
  `day1_first_move_v1` enabled with default variation `on` and no targeting rules;
  Worker `hivemind-day1-lifecycle`, deployed version
  `cf1d4048-ac88-4bbc-9cba-b5c66a996d89`.
- Rollout evidence: all three eligible organizations started through the same
  authenticated deterministic lifecycle endpoint; all three Workflow instances
  completed. PostgreSQL recorded three linked, uniquely deduplicated
  `lifecycle.email.sent` platform notifications and zero duplicate dedupe keys.
- Local acceptance: `singulance-local` commit
  `b15b4ceb5d354f9281626cad9bd863c153a1ae6c`; 30 focused tests passed and the
  rebuilt local control-plane was healthy.
- Rollback: disable the Flagship flag for immediate evaluation rollback, or set
  `HIVEMIND_D1_WORKFLOW_ENABLED=false` as the backend master kill switch. The
  reconciliation scheduler remains throttled to five organizations per cron run.
